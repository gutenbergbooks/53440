<div>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <br />IN THE STUDY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The sun that pale spring afternoon had appeared
only in brief, tantalizing flashes. Of a sudden it
burst through the curtain of ashen gray clouds, behind
which it had been hiding, into flaming glory.
Its warm rays rioted down through the long windows
of Brooke Hamilton’s study, filling the stately
room with radiant light; transfiguring the face of
the single occupant.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh.” Marjorie Dean raised her brown eyes
from the time-stained sheet of paper she had been
studying. She greeted the wealth of cheerful sunburst
with a fond friendly smile, blinking a little
at its almost too-ardent attention. It caught her,
embraced her, caressed her lovely, smiling face;
splashed her bright brown curls with gold.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>“You’re an affectionatious old dear, even though
you <i>did</i> skulk behind the clouds all morning.” She
made a valiant but vain effort to fix her eyes directly
upon the king of day. “Can’t do it. You are
altogether too dazzling for me.” She raised a
shielding hand to her eyes. “Anyway, I’m glad
you are here, full force. I saw you peeping out
from behind the gray quite a while ago. I was too
busy then to be sociable.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Please, Missus Biographeress, were you talking
to me?” broke in an inquiring, respectful voice.
“I wasn’t always like this, so I wasn’t.” Came an
eloquent silence.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie left off trying to stare the sun out of
countenance. She glanced about the study in half
startled surprise. The door leading into it from
the hall was closed. She suddenly laughed, a merry
little gurgle. She fixed an expectant gaze on the
study’s back wall.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know where you are,” she called out. “No; I
wasn’t talking to you. I was talking to the sun.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then you must be crazy.” The voice was now
minus respect. Instead it harbored smothered
laughter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, Jeremiah Macy; I am <i>not</i> crazy. But I am
<i>very very</i> busy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s almost as bad as being crazy,” came the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>sympathetic opinion of the still unseen conversationalist.
“I hope you’re not too crazy, excuse me,
busy, to deign to grant your humble friend, Jeremiah,
an interview. Think of our happy bygone
campus days and don’t be snippy. Be not only
great, Bean; be cordial.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You win. Never dare call me snippy again.
Since you are <i>right behind</i> the secret panel you may
as well appear in the study.” Marjorie gave laughing
permission.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you. Your cordiality sounds genuine.
I trust nothing has gone wrong with my hearing.
Ahem. What?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The secret panel in the back wall of the study
slid noiselessly to the left; disappeared into its hidden
groove. The square opening it left framed
Jerry Macy’s chubby, pink and white features
decorated with a pleasant smile. Her head was
poked forward like that of a speculative turkey.
Her intensely blue eyes were trained upon Marjorie
with an expression of impudent mischief.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here I come.” She bent her back and bundled
through the aperture. “Ah-h!” She straightened
with satisfaction. “Always close the door after
you, Jeremiah.” She leaned forward; pressed the
small oblong of wood which formed the hidden
mechanism of the sliding panel. Next instant the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>opening had vanished. The high brown wainscoting
again stretched unbroken along the study’s rear
wall.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That secret panel is certainly a comfort to
my lonely old age, Bean.” Jerry cast a grateful
eye in its direction. “If I had come to the door of
this sacred haunt you might have chased me away.
But you couldn’t resist the panel method. Result—enter
Jeremiah.” Jerry waved a complacent hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s one version of how I happened to let you
in,” teased Marjorie. “Here’s another. I knew you
knew something new on the campus that I didn’t
know. So I ‘deigned to grant’ you an interview.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hm-m. You’re not as noble as you might be.
Never mind. We won’t speak of that,” Jerry hurriedly
assured.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So kind in you,” Marjorie murmured, “or
rather, so wise.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Precisely my own opinion. I may achieve
greatness as soon as you.” Without waiting for
an invitation Jerry slid into a high-backed chair
exactly opposite that of Marjorie at the long library
table.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The girls will be here at five,” she announced.
“They’re going to take us back to Wayland Hall
with them. Leila has a new idea for a party. We’re
to stay to dinner at the Hall. Miss Susanna’s resigned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>to it. She was invited, too, but she said she
was ‘no buttinski.’ What do you think of that?
It shows I’ve accomplished some good since I came
to the Arms. I’ve taught Miss Susanna several
pithy bits of slang, and Jonas is learning fast.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should say he was. The other day when he
took me to town in the car he told a motorist, who
tried to run in ahead of us to park, that he was
‘too fresh’ and to ‘cut out his nonsense.’” Marjorie
gave a reminiscent chuckle.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jerry smiled cheerful gratification of this news.
“To make use of my own pet vocabulary: It’s up
to me to show a hot-foot,” she declared. “While
I enjoy lingering in this classic spot with you,
beautiful Bean, I shall not linger. You heard what
I said about five o’clock. Heed my remarks. I
must go now.” She made a feeble pretense toward
rising. She rolled humorous, entreating eyes at
Marjorie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, you may stay.” Marjorie became loftily
tolerant. “First you may tell me everything you
know about Leila’s new stunt. Afterward, I have
a splendid job for you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know a single thing about Leila’s new
stunt. She ’phoned me about half an hour ago and
said she and Vera would come for us with the car
at five. She said she had a fine idea but that we’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>not hear a word about it until after dinner at Wayland
Hall tonight. Anything else I might say on
the subject I’d have to make up. You would not
care to have your faithful Jeremiah resort to fiction,
would you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re a faithful goose. I’m not so news-hungry
as to ask you to desert the truth, Jeremiah,”
was the merry assurance. “Leila, the rascal, knows
we’re eager for campus news and plans. She loves
to create suspense and keep it up till the very last
minute. Now I’m going to set you to work. You
may sort some letters for me, if you will.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will I? My middle name is willing!” Jerry
drew her chair closer to the table with a grand
flourish. A pleased light shone in her blue eyes.
She was very proud of having already assisted Marjorie
on several occasions in the work of arranging
the data, prior to the writing of Brooke Hamilton’s
biography.</p>

<p class='c005'>Readers of the four volumes comprising the
“<span class='sc'>Marjorie Dean High School Series</span>,” know
Marjorie Dean as a high school girl. They have
learned to know her still better through the four
volumes which comprise the “<span class='sc'>Marjorie Dean
College Series</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Returned to Hamilton College as a post graduate
her work in connection with the building of a free
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>dormitory for ambitious students in adverse circumstances
has already been recorded in the three
preceding volumes of the “<span class='sc'>Marjorie Dean Post
Graduate Series</span>,” respectively entitled “<span class='sc'>Marjorie
Dean, College Post Graduate</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Marjorie
Dean, Marvelous Manager</span>” and “<span class='sc'>Marjorie
Dean at Hamilton Arms</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Because Marjorie had deeply reverenced the
memory of Brooke Hamilton, the founder of Hamilton
College, she had come into an intimate friendship
with his great-niece, Miss Susanna Hamilton,
the only living representative of the Hamilton
family. For many years Miss Susanna had been
at enmity with the college board. Shortly after
the death of her distinguished great uncle, Brooke
Hamilton, she had turned against Hamilton College
and refused to furnish the data for a biography
of the founder which was to have been written by
the president of the college.</p>

<p class='c005'>Due entirely to Marjorie’s hopeful, sunny influence
Miss Susanna had eventually emerged from
the shell in which she had lived for years. She had
decided that, since Marjorie had most revered the
maxims and memory of her great kinsman, she was
therefore the one best equipped to present him truly
to the world in a biography. She had invited Marjorie
to be her guest indefinitely at Hamilton Arms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>and had turned over to the youthful biographer the
data for Brooke Hamilton’s life story.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie had said good-bye regretfully to Wayland
Hall, her college residence of almost five years
and moved to the Arms on the first day of March.
With her had gone a second cordially invited guest,
Jerry Macy, her roommate and chum of Sanford
high school days.</p>

<p class='c005'>During their first week’s stay at the Arms the
two girls had been the center of a jolly little social
whirl. Miss Susanna had insisted on entertaining
their intimate friends at tea, luncheon and dinner.
The festive week had ended with a reception to the
dormitory girls at which the Travelers, Jerry’s and
Marjorie’s sorority, were the guests of honor.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then had followed Marjorie’s introduction to
Brooke Hamilton’s study as her literary work shop.
There she had been affectionately established by
Miss Susanna and supplied with a cabinet full of
Brooke Hamilton’s personal letters and documents.</p>

<p class='c005'>How long she might be engaged in the pleasantest
task she had ever undertaken Marjorie could not
say. As a labor of volition it demanded the best
effort of thought and judgment that she could summon.
With her usual lack of vanity she was not
attaching much importance to herself as Brooke
Hamilton’s biographer. Her whole heart was set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>upon doing justice to a great American by a faithful
presentation to the world of his integrity and
genius.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you realize, Jerry Macy, that we’ve been
here at the Arms almost a month?” Her back to
Jerry, Marjorie asked the question as she delved
industriously among the packs of neatly tied letters
on the top shelf of the cabinet. “Today’s the
twenty-fifth of March.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know it. How much of Brooke Hamilton’s
story have you written?” Jerry came back curiously.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not any of it as I intend it shall finally stand,”
Marjorie confessed. “I’ve made plenty of notes,
but they only complicate matters at present. There
is so much material, all intensely interesting. It
would make a twelve volume biography. Miss Susanna
wishes it to be a one volume story. My head
is full of Hamilton history. It is positively maddening
sometimes to try to keep track of all I read,
and plan how I shall arrange it. I was never intended
for a biographer, Jeremiah.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You only think you weren’t,” Jerry encouraged.
“After you have got away with Brooke Hamilton’s
history and covered your beautiful self with glory
you may take up biographing as a steady job. I’ll
permit you to jot down the story of my life. I’ll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>try to persuade my friends to confide their life
stories to you for publication. There’s old Hal,
for instance. He—. Oh, forgive me, Marjorie.
I didn’t intend to be personal.” Jerry’s instant
apology was regretful. “I wasn’t thinking of a
thing, but the funny side of Hal’s having his biography
written.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, never mind, Jeremiah.” Marjorie was more
embarrassed by Jerry’s apology than she was at
mention of Hal’s name. Her face flushed hotly.
She kept it turned toward the cabinet, rather than
let Jerry see her confusion. A pause, then she
added generously: “Hal is good enough to do great
things in the world. Perhaps <i>you</i> may someday
write his biography as that of a personage. There!
Found at last.” She affected deep interest in two
bundles of letters which she took from the cabinet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, Marvelous Manager; I can’t see myself as
Hal’s biographer. He’d insist upon seeing every
line I biographed before it was hardly off the bat.
He wouldn’t like a thing I said about him. If I
wrote words of glorious praise, he’d say ‘stuff’ and
‘slush.’ If I failed to glorify him as a baseball
artist, a promoter of yacht races and a four-time
winner of the Sanford half-mile dash, he’d say I
was stingy.” Jerry retrieved her blunder with this
humorous flow. “<i>No, siree.</i> My genius runs toward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>jingling, not biographing. Get that? If Hal
ever longs to see the story of his life in print he’ll
have to get busy and write it himself.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <br />THE WORLD WIDE SECRET</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Marjorie was laughing as she resumed her seat
at the study table. She was quick to understand the
purpose of Jerry’s ridiculous and elaborate objections
to her really sincere words concerning Hal.
Her flash of self-conscious embarrassment had vanished
in quick amusement of Jerry’s remarks.</p>

<p class='c005'>“These are letters to Brooke Hamilton from
friends,” she explained as she shoved the two packs
across the table to Jerry.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He must have been right in line for a popularity
prize.” Jerry eyed the tightly-bound, thick stacks
of letters with comical respect.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They represent the correspondence of only four
or five men. Each letter isn’t from a different person,
my child,” Marjorie said lightly. “Your job
is to put the letters of each person in separate piles.
You may have that end of the table all to yourself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I get you, Bean.” Jerry energetically gathered
up the two packs of letters and moved with them
to the upper end of the table. “Watch my speed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>my efficiency, my celostrous usefulness. By the
way, my new word is on the gain. I’ve persuaded
Jonas to use it, Miss Susanna thinks well of it and
Leila says it is clever enough to be Irish.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s a good imitation. Celostrous—sounds like
a real word, even though it isn’t,” laughingly commented
Marjorie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sh-h-h. Somebody might hear you.” Jerry
held up a cautioning finger. She cast a roguish
smile toward a vividly handsome face which looked
down at her from a portrait on the wall. It was the
face of Brooke Hamilton. Life-size and life-like
the deep blue eyes seemed almost to twinkle an answer
to Jerry’s mischievous smile as she continued
to gaze at the portrait.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’s so real.” Marjorie turned her head over
one shoulder to glance up at the pictured face of a
strong man in the noon of manhood. A friendly
smile played upon her lips. “I hope you haven’t
minded my sitting with my back to you this afternoon,
Mr. Brooke,” she apologized.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If that was a magic portrait this is the way it
would be. ‘Then the enchanted portrait spoke from
the wall and said: “Don’t mention it, beautiful
Bean. Go as far as you like. Even the back of
your head is an inspiration to me. I can never be
grateful enough to you for writing my biography.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>How is your friend, Miss Macy? She is a lovely
girl and I—”’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Jeremiah, you disrespecter of great persons!”
Marjorie sprang from her chair and made a frolicsome
pounce upon Jerry. “Stop it this minute.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The two tussled gently for a brief instant, then
fell laughingly apart. The blue eyes of the man in
the portrait seemed almost to be watching the
merry conflict.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You see how utterly you disrupt serious work,”
Marjorie pointed out severely. “I have half a mind
to take the job I gave you away from you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You can’t. I have it cinched.” Jerry snatched
up the two packs of letters and tucked one under
each arm. “I love the job. I’ll do better, Bean.
I promise on my sacred Jeremiah honor.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I haven’t the heart to take those letters away
from you,” Marjorie jestingly conceded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Glad of it. Kindly don’t bother me. I am going
to give a violent demonstration of the word
‘work.’ It’s three o’clock now.” Jerry peered down
at the tiny open-face, necklace watch she wore
about her neck on a fine-linked platinum chain.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I knew it was nearly three. I’ve learned to tell
time by the sun since I came to the Arms and began
my work here.” There was no timepiece in the
study, nor would Marjorie wear a watch when she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>came into it to work. She did not wish to reckon
her daily faithful application to the biography by
time. She liked to lose herself in the thought that
all time was hers in which to do Brooke Hamilton’s
memory honor.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jerry followed her announcement of industry by
a business-like attack upon one of the packs of letters.
Soon she was deep in carrying out Marjorie’s
directions. Marjorie resumed a reading of the
paper in which she had been engrossed when Jerry
had entered. It was a dissertation on democracy
in Brooke Hamilton’s fine, clear hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>Silence took up its reign in the study. Marjorie
was deep in the dissertation. Oblivious to all else
Jerry interestedly sorted letters, reading pertinent
snatches of them. Neither saw the sliding panel
in the back wall of the study begin to move slowly.
Neither saw Miss Susanna’s head appear in the
opened square.</p>

<p class='c005'>For fully a minute the old lady watched the industrious
pair with brooding, tender eyes. She had
thought Marjorie alone in the study and had come
to her by the secret entrance in the same spirit of
play which had prompted Jerry to use the sliding
panel. In one hand were three letters for Marjorie
which Jonas had just brought from the mail box at
the main gates of the Arms.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>As soundlessly as she had appeared in the secret
doorway the visitant disappeared. In noiseless
obedience to her touch the panel slid once more into
place. Miss Susanna trotted down the long hall and
on down the wide staircase. Her small face was
illumined by a bright smile. She looked as though
she had suddenly discovered the world-sought secret
of happiness.</p>

<p class='c005'>She continued on out the massive front door,
down the steps and across the lawn to where Jonas
was clipping long sprays of furry pussy willows for
the two tall Chinese vases at each end of the sitting
room mantel.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You ought to see them, Jonas,” she burst out
happily. “They’re both in the study, lost to the
world among Uncle Brooke’s papers. I came away
without their knowing I saw them. I couldn’t bear
to disturb his helpers, Jonas. And I once thought
no one but the president of Hamilton College was
fitted to write his biography!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Strange things happen, Miss Susanna.” Jonas’s
silver head wagged itself solemnly over the huge
bunch of pussy willows he was holding. “He’d be
better pleased, though, to have things as they are
now. I believe he’d rather the little girl would
write his story.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Jonas invariably spoke of Brooke Hamilton as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>one alive, but traveling in a far country, rather
than of a man who had passed from earth.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think so, too, Jonas.” The instant, eager response
brought a pleased gleam to the old man’s
eyes. “He founded Hamilton College for the higher
education of girls. It seems as though Hamilton
has at last shown appreciation of him by raising up
a student after his own heart. That student is
Marjorie Dean.” She paused, apparently taken
with her own fancy. She added sturdily: “All the
more reason why she should be the one to write
his biography.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <br />TWO HAUNTING BLUE EYES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Hurray for Wayland Hall!” Jerry sketched a
lively step in front of the dressing table mirror
as she gave her reflection a last fleeting glance.
“The Arms is a magnificent, palatial roost, but
where, oh, where, are our little pals?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“At Wayland Hall. Sometimes I wonder if you
might not be happier there with the girls than here
with me.” Marjorie brought a half wistful look
to bear upon Jerry. She stood gazing at her chum,
a lovely contemplative study in black and white.
The straight cut of her white corduroy gown with
its wide rolling collar and deep cuffs of black satin
was so simple as to be exceptionally effective.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Want me to shake you until your curls bob
straight off your head and your teeth clatter like
castanets,” Jerry growled menacingly. She made a
threatening advance upon Marjorie, her blue eyes
set in a determined stare.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, indeed.” Marjorie promptly put a high-backed
chair between herself and Jerry. “I’ll protect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>my coiffure to the last gasp. I took pains to
put those curls precisely where I wanted them to
be.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then don’t make any more foolish remarks,
Bean.” Jerry halted. The set expression of her
eyes changed to one of dancing fun. “I’ll set you
a good example by not making any more myself
that might even sound foolish. I know my own
follies as well as I know yours.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie leaned her arms on the crest of the tall-backed
chair. She smiled rather absently. How
like Hal’s eyes Jerry’s were, she was thinking. Recent
mention of Hal had brought him to the foreground
of her mind. Now she thrust memory of
him impatiently aside.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll be nicer to you than you were to me,” she
told Jerry. “You look very celostrous, Jeremiah.”
“Celostrous” was a pet word of Jerry’s own coining.
“Your dress matches your eyes and the silver
beading on it looks like fairy mist. It’s a frock
of frocks.” Marjorie continued her admiring survey
of Jerry and her becoming finery. As she had
remarked the gentian blue of the crepe exactly
matched her chum’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again Hal’s handsome, resolute features sprang
into memory. This time memory played her an
unkind trick. She saw Hal’s eyes as they had appeared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>in that unforgettable, unguarded moment as
he had paused before the portrait of herself at
Castle Dean on Christmas Day.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had then come into a very disturbing realization
of how much pain she was causing him
through her lack of love for him. She had tried
to forget, knowing that she could offer no remedy.
Work had largely driven away that disturbing
memory since her return to Hamilton. Those two
blue, despairing eyes returned to haunt her only
upon receipt of a letter from their possessor. There
had been only two letters. Marjorie had not answered
either very promptly. She sometimes went
so far as to feel that she might be better pleased
not to hear from Hal. Still she did not wish to
deny him friendship.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are <i>too sweet</i> for words.” Jerry broke in
upon her train of reflection. She purposely simpered
so as to hide her pleased embarrassment of Marjorie’s
compliments.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Am I?” Marjorie was not even seeing Jerry
now. She was seeing Jerry’s brother who refused
to retire from her somber reflections. No; she
valued Hal’s friendship as dearly as she did Leila’s,
Jerry’s or that of any of her chums. Her adoration
was for her captain and her general only. Now
that she had a clearer understanding of Hal’s disappointment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>she felt a more personal sorrow toward
him. She had glimpsed the desolation of a
strong man’s soul. The revelation had awakened
in her a truer sympathy for him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come out of it.” Jerry had paused directly in
front of the chair on which Marjorie was leaning
her elbows. She waved her arms making vigorous
passes before the day-dreamer’s face. “What is the
matter, Bean? Two minutes ago you were one
grand sweet smile. Now your expression is werry
sad. You <i>have not</i> lost your last friend, Bean.
Take heart. Jeremiah is here. Ah! I have it!
Nothing like Bean Jingles to put the chee in chirk.
Here we go!</p>

      <div class='line in1'>All dressed up in your best.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“According to your jingle ‘resplendent Bean’ must
resemble a vain, strutting peacock.” Marjorie came
out of her retrospective reverie with a giggle.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, indeed. I never meant to suggest such a
thing. Regard yourself as a bird of Paradise, dear
Bean,” Jerry corrected.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am not so conceited. Besides, I’m not dressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>up in my best. This particular set of feathers is far
from gorgeous; and not even my second best.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have a heart. Remember the claim of poetic
license, and respect it. Your practical, unpoetic
criticism is <i>so</i> discouraging. Don’t put on the
brake. There are more rhythmic inspirations to

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <br />THE SPRINGTIME OF THE HEART</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“And you will please trouble yourself to recite
that jingle again before it vanishes into nothingness,”
commanded a laughing voice from the doorway
of the large, old-fashioned sleeping room.
Leila Harper stood in the half-opened door, an attractive
figure in the newest of English leather
motor coats and sports hats.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Leila Greatheart, what a <i>dandy</i> coat and hat!”
Marjorie cried. She came forward, hands outstretched
to meet Leila.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here I come with a fine Irish dash.” Leila made
a funny cat-like leap into the room and caught
Marjorie’s welcoming hands in hers. “It is a hundred
years since I saw you; or so it seems,” she
said in her whimsical way. “Now I shall say not a
word more until I have taken down Jeremiah’s
jingle. I happen to have a pencil, and bewitching
Bean herself will furnish her Celtic friend with a
bit of paper.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“At your service. Let me conduct you to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>writing desk,” Marjorie took Leila’s arm and escorted
her to an open antique mahogany desk. She
motioned Leila into the mahogany chair before it.
“There you are.” She indicated several sizes of
pale gray note paper bearing the monogram of the
Arms. “Isn’t this beautiful paper, Leila?” she
commented. “Miss Susanna put it here on purpose
for us. She never uses it. She prefers white. This
was Mr. Brooke Hamilton’s own stationary.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are two lucky children in a fairy castle,”
Leila declared. “Now say me the jingle, Jeremiah.
Then we will talk about everything and anything.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ahem.” Jerry coughed importantly. “I may have
to depend upon bewitching Bean to help me. I
never remember my own ravings—inspirations, I
should say. Inspiration is—it is—well, it just is.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is it?” Leila inquired with raised brows and an
engaging grin.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It certainly is,” Jerry responded with a difficult
solemnity. It broke up in an amused high-keyed
chuckle. Merely to glance at Leila, posed in an
attitude of expectant and ridiculous affability was
to laugh.</p>

<p class='c005'>After one or two hitches and a little prompting
from Marjorie who also had designs on Jerry’s
funny effusions, Leila managed to record the three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>jingles, though she had arrived in time to hear only
the last one of them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now we have a beginning.” She exhibited open
satisfaction of the penciled copy of Jerry’s lively
doggerel. She folded it twice and placed it in a
pocket of her leather motor coat. “I shall expect
you to take down and save me all future jingles of
Jeremiah, Beauty, since you are the inspiration.
Never fail to do so. Now you may talk to me
about anything. I am so gracious.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have copies of two jingles that Jeremiah
spouted last week on an occasion when I brought
her four letters from the mail-box. I’ll mail you
copies of them tomorrow. Where is Midget? I
know she can’t be far away.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie glanced inquiringly at Leila.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She is lost somewhere in space downstairs. She
is but a small doll in this great house. And you
now promise me two more jingles. Two and two
are four, and four is better than two. Soon we
shall have a book. It must have a green crushed
Levant binding with a portrait of Jeremiah reciting
one of her own jingles as a frontispiece and the
story of her life printed in gold letters on the front
cover.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It looks as though I might become as famous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>as Bean, Harper, Page or any other campus high
light if that crushed Levant edition doesn’t flivver,”
Jerry said hopefully.</p>

<p class='c005'>Full of their usual light-hearted raillery the trio
of girls presently went downstairs to find not only
Vera Mason in the sitting room with Miss Hamilton.
Ronny Linde, Muriel Harding, Lucy Warner and
Robin Page as well were there, clustered around
Miss Susanna. They greeted Jerry and Marjorie
with a concerted shout and rushed them affectionately.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How did the four of you manage to keep so
quiet?” Jerry demanded. “I’m amazed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You needn’t be. You were so noisy yourselves
you didn’t hear us. But <i>we</i> heard <i>you</i>,” Vera assured.
“We heard three different varieties of giggle,
all going at once. Leila was told to hurry upstairs
and bring you down instantly. Instead—” She
cast an accusing glance at Leila.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, but you were in good company, so I may
be forgiven.” Leila made a gallant bow to Miss
Susanna.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You certainly are a fine Irish gentleman with
your lordly manner and nice leather overcoat,” complimented
Miss Susanna, her brown eyes dancing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Am I not?” modestly agreed Leila. “What I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>need most to make me impressive is a pair of green
leather boots and a chimney pot hat.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll cast you as the romantic Irish hero of a play
in precisely that costume. See if I don’t,” Robin
Page laughingly threatened.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who will write the play?” Leila quizzed interestedly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You of course.” Robin leveled a designating finger
at Leila. “That’s a bully idea; to give a romantic
Irish play. And for once you may act as well as
be stage manager. So glad I happened to see you
this afternoon and hear about your green leather
boots and chimney pot hat.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“As you will not require anything of me but to
write the play, manage the stage and play the leading
part I’ll not change your gladness to sorrow by
snubbing you. Still I am wondering where I am
to find the boots and the hat. And let me add a
condition of my own. I will not be stage manager,
actor or playwright unless Miss Susanna will promise
to come to the show.” Leila launched this proviso
with her most ingratiating smile in Miss Hamilton’s
direction.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll come,” the old lady obligingly promised. Now
that she had “surrendered,” as she humorously
termed her change of heart toward Hamilton College
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>she was almost as eager as her girls to have
some part in campus fun and enterprise. “Will it
be a house play?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No it will not.” Marjorie and Robin spoke the
same words, and almost together. They looked at
each other and laughed. The same thought had
prompted the same answer.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wise Page and Dean. They see money in featuring
Leila as the hero in her green boots and chimney
pot hat,” was Ronny’s light explanation of the exchange
of eye messages.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do we? Well, <i>rather</i>!” Marjorie said with
warmth.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Uh-huh,” emphasized Robin. “The campus
dwellers will mob the gym to see Irish Leila as an
Irish hero in an Irish play. We’ll reap a bully harvest
of dollars for the dormitory.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You and Vera can do that Irish contra dance you
danced at Page and Dean’s first show when we were
junies.” Muriel grew animated. “In itself it’s worth
the price of admission.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, <i>do</i> have it in the play, Leila,” rose the general
plea.</p>

<p class='c005'>Leila bowed, hand over her heart. “How
celebrated Midget and Leila are! That means Midget
must play the part of the maid from Lough Gur,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>of the county Limerick. That is the place in Ireland
where the fairies yet hold their invisible revels.
And I think Midget might be taken for one of the
Lough Gur fairy queens,” she said fancifully. “I
am afraid to invite her home with me to Ireland
for fear the fairy folk may steal her and shut her
up in a mountain.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not if I see them first,” Vera was positive upon
this point.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Midget is small, but valiant.” Leila rolled laughing
eyes at her friends. “Ah, but you would not <i>see</i>
the fairies, Midget, when they slipped you away.
You would not see them until you were safe inside
the mountain.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then I’ll keep far from Ireland. I’ll be Irish in
plays only,” Vera vowed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Be sure and save a good part for Luciferous
Warneriferous,” was Muriel’s next thoughtful request.
“She simply loves to act.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I do not.” Lucy looked alarmed. A gale
of laughter went up at her horrified denial. “I can’t
act. You know that, Muriel Harding.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You should learn to act,” Muriel said with
severity. “It is your duty. <i>I</i> am giving you good
advice. These persons are laughing at you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who made them laugh? Keep your advice. I’m
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>furious with <i>you</i>. Br-r-r-r!” Lucy shook her head
savagely, thrust her chin forward and fixed her
greenish eyes upon Muriel in a frozen glare which
convulsed that delighted wag. She thoroughly enjoyed
teasing dignified Lucy to the point of retaliating.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, splendid! You look every inch a villain!”
Muriel simulated profound admiration. “You have
true histrionic ability, Luciferous. Let my flattering
opinion sink deep, and encourage you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll let it go in one ear and out the other,” was
Lucy’s derisive retort. “Don’t <i>dare</i> choose me
even for a villager in your Irish play, Leila Harper.
I’ll be far more useful as a press agent. I’ll get up
a handbill about the play, and mimeograph it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bully idea, Luciferous. Be sure and hit all the
high spots. When you have the handbills ready
you may stand outside Hamilton Hall and distribute
them to the campus dwellers.” Jerry patted Lucy
on the shoulder with force.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ouch! That’s one of my high spots you just
hit.” Lucy dodged out of Jerry’s reach, rubbing her
assaulted shoulder. “I’d rather give out handbills
any time than act,” she declared with a defiant glance
at laughing Muriel.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Be calm, Luciferous,” soothed Leila with an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>assuring grin. “I would rather have the handbills
than you on the stage as a villain. It is Matchless
Muriel who may have the pleasure of playing that
part. She will have plenty of lines to learn.” Leila
nodded significantly toward Muriel who merely continued
to smile.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Biographers, bill posters, stage managers, actors,
et cetera; attention!” Vera called out. She
pointed to the tall floor clock, imperturbably ticking
off the minutes. “It’s five minutes to six. Too
bad I always have to be time crier for this reckless
aggregation.” She heaved a dismal sigh. “What
<i>would</i> you do without me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Be laggards all the rest of our lives, faithful
Midget. You are one of the world’s finest institutions.”
Leila beamed patronizing appreciation on
her diminutive chum.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know my own worth. I am surprised to find
you have an inkling of it,” Vera retorted with complacent
dignity.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A dignified Midget is so impressive,” murmured
Leila. “See how wrapped up in her small
self she is. She has forgotten about being town
crier. I see I must—.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t trouble yourself. I’m still on the job.
It’s now five minutes later than it was five minutes
ago,” Vera hastily announced.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“Come, good Travelers.” Muriel took the middle
of the floor in a stiff recitative attitude. Raising
one arm she declaimed in a high stilted voice: “Let
us journey with all speed toward shelter ere dark
night o’ertakes us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Something like that,” was Ronny’s ultra modern
agreement. “With so much talk and so little action
it may be midnight ere we see the Hall. I’m not
speaking of myself, or of Miss Susanna. We’re
not loquacious.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i>You</i> only miss being loquacious because you
haven’t happened to start an argument with Matchless
Muriel. I should hope you <i>weren’t</i> speaking of
Miss Susanna.” Jerry put on a shocked expression.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t squabble over me,” Miss Hamilton said
in a meek little voice. Followed a burst of ready
laughter. She said as it died out: “I’m going to
send you home now, children. Come back tomorrow
evening to dinner. Bring Kathie and Lillian
with you. Robin, please invite Phil and Barbara.
Tell Phil to bring her fiddle. I will invite Peter
and Anne Graham, and Signor Baretti. He will
like to come to our party. He and Peter will be
company for Jonas. I shall make Jonas sit at the
table with us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Travelers thought Miss Susanna’s sisterly
regard for Jonas one of her finest characteristics.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>While he had been a youthful servitor of the Hamiltons
during Brooke Hamilton’s declining years,
he had filled the triple role of brother, servitor and
friend to the Lady of the Arms during her long
lonely reign in the great house. He was many
years older than Miss Susanna, but still a strong,
sturdy man.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jonas looked upon Miss Susanna as an empress,
to be reverenced and obeyed. Miss Hamilton’s oft
repeated assertion to him: “You are a direct importation
of Providence, Jonas, willed me by Uncle
Brooke,” had made a deep impression on him at
first utterance. As a consequence, his one aim in
life was that of faithful service. Rarely could she
coax him to appear socially at the Arms, even
among the few friends who knew his worth.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re always thinking up something perfectly,
splendidly hospitable!” As she rose from her chair
to see the Travelers to the front door Marjorie
pounced lovingly upon the Lady of the Arms, wrapping
both arms around her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A hold up, a hold up!” cried Jerry. “I’m going
to join in it.” She made a playful attempt to
pry Marjorie’s arms loose from about the old lady.
The others gathered around the pair, mischievous
and laughing. They put Miss Susanna through a
gentle wooling which left her with ruffled hair, her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>lace collar awry and her cheeks pink from the loving
salutes of fresh young lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Travelers went down the wide stone walk
from the house looking back, waving and calling
gay good-byes to the small, alert woman at the
head of the veranda steps. The gate reached, Marjorie
turned to wave her hand again. She mentally
contrasted Miss Susanna’s happy expression of the
present occasion with the sharp, doubting, half resentful
gaze the mistress of the Arms had turned
upon her when she had first been ushered into the
library by Jonas to meet Brooke Hamilton’s kinswoman.
Where there had once been shadow, somber
silence, loneliness, was now light of love, gay
friendly voices, sympathy, companionship.</p>

<p class='c005'>It had been Miss Susanna’s wish that Marjorie
and Jerry should be at the Arms to greet the return
of Spring. Remembering this a rare, rapturous
flash of exaltation swept over Marjorie. She was
thinking as she waved her hand to the little old
lady on the veranda that Spring had not only returned
to the Arms. It had miraculously returned
to Miss Susanna’s heart.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <br />FOR THE GOOD OF THE “DORM”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“What’s on your mind, Leila Greatheart?
You’ve thrown out tantalizing little scraps of what
I’d call non-information ever since we left the
Arms. Now stand, and deliver.” Marjorie made
her plea for enlightenment as Leila closed the door
of her room and favored her chums with one of her
bland, wide smiles.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dinner over at the Hall, the eight Travelers had
lingered in Miss Remson’s snug office to talk to the
little manager for a pleasant half hour. They had
just made port in Leila’s and Vera’s room for what
promised to be a most interesting session.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s on my mind, Beauty?” Leila regarded
Marjorie owlishly. “More than you might think,
should you judge by appearance,” she said with
mock seriousness. “I am enchanted with myself
because of my own schemes. Sit in a circle around
me and listen to the golden runes of Leila, the
witch woman. I see gold, gold, gol-l-d.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She made a sudden forward sweep of the arm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>toward Jerry who was about to seat herself on
Vera’s couch beside Lucy Warner. Jerry raised
a mild shriek of surprise, flopped against Lucy who
was near the end of the couch. Unprepared for
such a jolt, Lucy rolled off the end of the couch to
the floor. Jerry clutched wildly at her arm. Her
balance upset she followed Lucy to the floor and
sat down upon her amid shouts of merriment from
the six gleeful spectators to the double mishap.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now see where you put me.” Jerry still sat on
the floor regarding Leila with an air of deep injury.
Lucy had scrambled to her feet and made
for a chair. “The very least you can do is help
me up. Give me your hands, and don’t dare let
go.” Jerry held up her hands to her still mirthful
hostess.</p>

<p class='c005'>Leila essayed the task of raising Jerry to her feet.
Laughter robbed her of power to lift Jerry. It
also robbed Jerry of power to raise herself from
the floor. After three separate attempts at co-operation,
all mirthfully unsuccessful, Jerry was
hoisted to her feet by the combined efforts of Marjorie,
Ronny and Muriel.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are an awful hostess.” Jerry opened her
mouth widely on “awful” and ducked her head
violently forward at Leila. “First you scare your
guests by making wild sweeping swoops at them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Then you laugh at them when they come to grief.
This time I’ll choose the middle of the couch, and
be safe.” Very cautiously she re-seated herself on
the couch, squarely in the center.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll sit one on each side of you, Jeremiah, so
that you can’t fall off the couch again.” Ronny
plumped down on the couch on one side of Jerry.
Muriel obligingly seated herself on the other side.</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i>I</i> was shoved off that couch and sat upon by
Jeremiah, yet no one appears to remember it,” Lucy
mournfully complained.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I remember it. You tipped me off your lap,”
accused Jerry.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But you tipped me off the couch first,” reminded Lucy.
“I forgive you, but never again will I
sit on a couch beside you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I always try to look upon everything that happens
as for the best,” Jerry returned with angelic
sweetness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There were no bones broken, but there was
plenty of fuss made.” Leila thus summed up the
accident. “Now pay attention to me, and let us
have no more nonsense.” Whereupon she burst out
laughing, thus starting her companions’ merriment
afresh.</p>

<p class='c005'>Quiet finally restored she began again. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>time with the fine earnestness which she could
readily summon when occasion demanded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Travelers, dear,” she addressed the now attentive
seven, “we have left only six days of March,
then April, May and the early part of June in which
to earn money for the dormitory. We must give
as many shows as we can manage between now
and Commencement. We must give the Irish play
the first week in May. I shall write it in one week.
It will be nothing startling, but it will be a play,
I grant you that. I shall have a sorry siege to
make the cast learn their lines in two weeks. It
must be done. We must rehearse four nights in a
week. Vera will make cunning Irish token cards
and we shall sell them for a silver quarter apiece.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“First I had heard of my new job, but I accept.
May I inquire into the mystery of an Irish token
card?” Vera asked with an assumption of profound
respect.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You will draw many little pictures of the cast,
Midget, on many little cards,” was Leila’s somewhat
indefinite answer. “You will learn more about my
Celtic schemes when I am not so busy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, very well. See that <i>you</i> don’t interrupt any
of <i>my</i> busy hours. If you see me put up a busy
sign on my side of the room, respect it,” warned
Vera.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“See that <i>you</i> do not again interrupt <i>me</i>,” flung
back Leila, scowling portentously at her diminutive
roommate.</p>

<p class='c005'>Everyone else interrupted, however, and Leila
had to come to a laughing stop in her harangue
until she had enlightened the party regarding “Irish
token cards.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Like her artist father, Vera was gifted with the
ability to draw. Leila’s idea of having small, head-and-shoulder,
pen-and-ink sketches of the various
characters in the play drawn on oblong cards, three
by one and a half inches, was decidedly interesting
from an artistic as well as a financial standpoint.
Below the sketch would appear the stage name of
the character, the true name and the date of the
play.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Vera won’t be able to do many cards, Leila.
She won’t have time. She can’t make the rough
sketches until we have our costumes and know ourselves
how we are going to look,” was Ronny’s
doubtful view of the feature.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I can draw the different characters as they
ought to look. Leila can show me the style of costume
to be followed by the actors. I’ll draw each
character once, leaving out the features till I know
who will be who. Then I can fill in the blanks with
the familiar eyes, noses, mouths and ears of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>illustrious cast. After that it will only mean hours
and hours of tedious copying my originals.” Vera
made a triumphant outspreading gesture of the arms
indicative of her mastery of the situation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How we do miss Ethel Laird,” sighed Ronny.
“She was so clever. Do you remember how gorgeous
those posters for the first show were that she
painted. What became of them, Marvelous Manager?”
She looked quickly toward Marjorie as
though seized with a sudden idea.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They’re with the other properties in the Page
and Dean section of the garret,” Marjorie replied.
“At least they were still there the last time I was
up garret. That was after the Valentine masquerade.
What is it, Ronny? I see you have something
on your mind.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let’s have an auction,” eagerly proposed Ronny.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not now; not until the first of June. We could
clear up all the stuff we have used for advertising
the shows, and other treasures of our own that
have campus history, and auction them off. Let
Jerry be the auctioneer. Oh, lovely! What?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, lovely,” mimicked Jerry. “There is nothing
very lovely about hard labor.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No use in pretending, Jeremiah. You know
you’d revel in being an auctioneer.” Ronny shook
her finger at Jerry.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“I’ve heard of worse stunts,” Jerry admitted with
a grin.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have nearly as good an opinion of you, Ronny,
as I have of myself,” Leila graciously conceded.
“You and Jeremiah have my permission to manage
the auction. You may collect all the wares
for it, and do all the work. Between times, when
you have little to do, you may dance in my shows.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i>Your</i> shows?” Ronny’s eyebrows ascended to
a politely satiric height.</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i>My</i> shows,” repeated Leila with great firmness.
“Have you not yet learned that Page and Dean
amount to little without me. It is Harper and
Harper who should have all the credit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Right-o!” exclaimed Marjorie and Robin exactly
together.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now why did you agree with me?” Leila demanded,
her tone full of innocent Celtic surprise.
“That was merely one of my Celtic jests.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Many a true word,’ you know,” cited Robin.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll make you senior partner in the firm,
Leila Greatheart,” was Marjorie’s generous proposal.
“Harper, Page and Dean has a fine, dignified
sound.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Away with you!” Leila waved off the suggestion.
“I am deaf to such a sound. Say no more,
or I shall fly into one of my fierce frenzies. Now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>I am here not to rage, but to keep Midget in order,
and conduct this meeting.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i>In order?</i>” Vera interrogated in an awful voice.
“Kindly state <i>when</i> I have been out of order since
this go-as-you-please session began.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not at all, Midget; not at all—as yet,” Leila
laid significant stress on “as yet.” “So we may hope
for the best and change the subject,” she hastily
added.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s high time it was changed,” Vera said loftily.</p>

<p class='c005'>Leila turned comical eyes upon the company.
Then she continued: “Now we have the Irish play
and the auction on the carpet. Soon we shall be
giving Kathie’s new play: ‘The Knight of the
Northern Sun.’ Gentleman Gus will be featured
in that. Kathie had finished the writing of it.
Luciferous has already typed the parts. And I have
picked a fine heroine. The Ice Queen is to play the
part of Nageda, the Norse princess.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <br />A TANTALIZING GLIMPSE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Where did you collect the nerve to ask that
ask?” Jerry admiringly demanded of Leila, following
the shout of surprise from the others.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have nerve for any occasion,” was the modest
reply.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I believe you. What did the Ice Queen say to
you, or was she too icily iced for words? I get
you that she must have made a ‘yes’ sign, in spite
of her freezing frozenness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She said ‘yes.’ I went straight to the point
with plenty of coolness in my own sweet Irish
voice,” Leila answered with a touch of grimness.
“She loves to be a center of attraction. I have a
good idea of her beauty and cleverness. She knows
that. We made the bargain like two veterans. She
does not wish for my friendship. I can live without
hers. We have in Ireland our own proverb of
fair exchange. It is: ‘To exchange needs with
your neighbor is nothing lost to him or you.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In this instance it is everything gained,” Marjorie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>blithely asserted. “You are the same old
wonder, Leila Greatheart. I must make a list of
these coming attractions now.” She opened the
small blue leather notebook which she was seldom
without now wherever she happened to go on the
campus. She wrote busily for a little, oblivious of
the murmur of discussion going on around her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Three sure-fire attractions,” she exulted, as she
presently glanced up from her notebook.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve something to report, too. I’ve at last persuaded
Miss Oliver to let us feature her in a musicale
in Greek Hall. It’s to come off a week from
Friday evening.” Robin’s announcement was
touched with pride.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was the signal for another little burst of surprise.
While Candace Oliver, the freshman musical
genius who one of the Craig Hall girls had discovered,
had on several occasions reluctantly played
for Robin and a few other admiring students, she
had steadily refused to appear on the college stage
as a pianiste.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Another obstacle surmounted. How did you do
it? I thought I was too persuasive to be resisted,
but she turned me down,” commented Muriel.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I asked her to let us feature her, every time
I met her. I used all the nice pleasant arguments
I could think of but without effect. The other day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>I happened to meet her at Baretti’s. I introduced
Signor Baretti to her. I was sitting at the same
table with her and Baretti came up, as always, to
speak to me. He only stayed a minute, but in that
minute I remarked to him that Miss Oliver was
a wonderful pianiste. He looked truly impressed
and said in his odd way: ‘I like hear you play
som’time. When you play in Miss Page, Miss
Dean’s show, for help the dormitory. Miss Page,
you come tell me when Miss Ol-ee-var play.’ I
smiled at Miss Oliver. She had turned red as a
poppy. Then I said, sweet as cream: ‘I surely
<i>will</i> let you know, Signor Baretti.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What did she say?” Ronny voiced the question
that stood in six pairs of bright eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, he trotted off just then, and I didn’t give
her time to say a word. I began telling her about
him and how sincere his interest in the dormitory
was, and how he had fought for Page and Dean,
and how altogether great-spirited he was. She
listened without saying much. She was half through
luncheon when I sat down at her table. She left
the restaurant as soon as she had finished her dessert.
Next day I received a four line note from
her. She said in it that she had changed her mind
about not being featured at a musicale. ‘I wish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>to do my part to help the dorm’ girls,’ was the line
that made Robin execute a hornpipe.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The infallible Guiseppe again to the rescue,”
Vera said lightly, yet with a certain pleased intonation
which expressed the appreciation underlying it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Attraction number four.” Amid the gratified
murmur which followed Robin’s recital, Marjorie
set down the musicale in her book. “What is Miss
Oliver’s program, Robin? Of course you’ve seen
her since you received her note.” Marjorie knew
that Robin was sure of her prize.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Three Chopin numbers and Beethoven’s ‘Sonata
Appassionata.’ Phil is going to play one of Brahm’s
Hungarian dances and Jensen’s ‘Romance.’ Verna
Burkett is going to sing. She has a glorious contralto
voice, and Reba Hoffman, that little blonde
German dorm will give a ’cello number. I am
anxious to exploit dorm talent, too. It’s going to
be a hummer of a program. I think we ought to
charge two dollars apiece for the tickets, the same as
we charge for our revues. What do you think
about it, Marjorie?” Robin earnestly consulted
her partner. “You know we only charged a dollar
and a half for tickets for the last musicale.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t believe two dollars a seat will be considered
robbery. We always reserve free seats for
the dormitory girls at all the shows. The other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Hamiltonites can afford to pay two dollars apiece
for the kind of entertainment we shall offer.
They’d have to pay from two to three dollars apiece
for good seats at a special benefit musicale wherever
they might go,” was Marjorie’s candid reply.
“I don’t wish to seem priggish, but they could spend
their allowance checks for no better cause.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“True as truth, good partner,” Robin agreed,
with a saucy little nod. “Oh, dear,” she changed
to plaintive in a twinkling. “I wish we might use
the Hamilton Concert Hall for the musicale. Think
of the money we’d take in. Greek Hall is hardly
more than half as large.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why can’t you use it?” asked Lucy Warner
with crisp suddenness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No one has the nerve to ask Prexy for the use
of it, my child.” Vera bent a benign glance upon
Lucy which contrasted oddly with her doll-like
daintiness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why not?” Lucy persisted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Prexy has yet to come to one of our shows,
Luciferous,” Marjorie said quietly. “We’ve always
sent him tickets, and Mrs. Prexy and her
friends have come to them. But he never has. He
approves of the dormitory enterprise. He has been
friendly with me on all occasions, but—” Marjorie
smiled—“he never appears at our revues.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“It’s the one thorn on Page and Dean’s rosebush,”
laughed Robin. “Besides, Luciferous, we’ve
never felt like trying to break into the regular college
lecture and concert programs with our shows.
It’s more a matter of deference than anything else.
If he had ever offered the hall to us, we’d have
accepted the offer instanter. But he never has.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I believe it never occurred to him,” Lucy said
bluntly. “I wish I’d known long ago. I’ll ask him
tomorrow for the use of it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lu-ciferous!” Muriel beamed on Lucy with a
radiance too joyous to be genuine. “You deserve
a citation. That is you will deserve one if you put
the Prexy problem across. Do so, and I will cite
your good conduct tomorrow evening in this very
room at precisely seven o’clock. You will receive a
tin star, three whacks on the shoulder and a ticket
to the Hamilton Movie Palace. Popcorn and pink
lemonade will be served to all.” Muriel effulgently
included the rest of the party in the generous invitation.</p>

<p class='c005'>The next five minutes were spent in jubilantly
rushing Lucy. She received approving pats on the
shoulders, pats on the back and pats on the head.
Each Traveler tried to outdo the other in contributing
funnily approving remarks. Muriel smilingly
proposed raising Lucy to Jerry’s and her shoulders
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>and parading about the room with her. Jerry and
Lucy both had strong objections to the honor
walk.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wouldn’t trust either of you to carry me two
feet,” Lucy declared mirthfully. “Now never mind
rushing me further. Leila beguiled us here with
the promise of hearing something extraordinary.
I have yet to hear it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So I did.” Leila surveyed the Travelers, whose
attention had quickly returned to her, her bright
blue eyes asparkle. “Now this is what I have to
say.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As she laid her plan before her chums, a constant
chorus of gurgles, giggles and chuckles accompanied
her words. The instant she paused
Jerry raised a not too loud cheer of approbation
which the others echoed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am indebted to you, Matchless Muriel, for suggesting
the proper kind of refreshments. You may
believe that popcorn and pink lemonade will be
served at our party along with gum drops and peppermint
sticks. I had not yet thought of the eats
until you spoke. Now I shall get up a fine spread.”
Leila’s tone conveyed her deep satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It will be oceans of fun.” Muriel had already
begun to laugh as she thought of what her part in
the event should be.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“The gentlemen of the campus may have to hunt
diligently for suitable wardrobe. I shall see about
mine at once.” Vera giggled softly.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her naive remark was the signal for a fresh explosion
of mirth. In a room further along the hall
a girl moodily rested her pen to listen to the breath
of laughter wafted faintly to her through walls and
closed doors. Doris Monroe tried to frown at the
distant sounds of harmonious comradeship. She
found that she was not angry. She was despondent
because she was lonely. She was beginning to
glimpse a side of college life, wholly desirable, but,
unfortunately for her, beyond her reach.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <br />THE DARK TOWER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Doris Monroe had seen Marjorie and Jerry in
the dining room of Wayland Hall that evening. She
knew the Travelers were holding a social session in
Leila’s and Vera’s room and somberly envied them
their fun. Things had been distressingly dull for
her since her return from the holiday vacation spent
with Leslie Cairns in New York.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had thoroughly enjoyed herself in New York
after Mrs. Gaylord, Leslie’s chaperon, had appeared
at the Essenden, the apartment hotel in which Leslie
had engaged the Dresden suite of rooms. Leslie,
too, had been more agreeable during that short,
blissful two weeks of fine dressing, expensive dinners,
luncheons and theatres than Doris had known
her to be either before or since the vacation.</p>

<p class='c005'>The few times she had been in Leslie’s company
after their return to Hamilton, Leslie had been preoccupied,
irritable and altogether unpleasant. She
had been so patently uncongenial that Doris had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>preferred to keep away from her on the plea of study.
This plea was at least sound. Doris had had her
hands full for a time in trying to stave off being
conditioned in mathematics.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had known nothing of Leslie’s downfall as a
business woman. It was at least three weeks after
Leslie had reluctantly obeyed her father’s mandate
and left Hamilton for New York before she had
written Doris a letter from an apartment on Central
Park West which Mrs. Gaylord had secured for the
two as a residence.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the letter Leslie had stated that she would return
to Hamilton for a few days early in April. She
had not, however, explained her sudden departure,
nor had she mentioned the disruption of her garage
enterprise. Doris had answered the letter, feeling
secretly relieved that Leslie was not in Hamilton.
She had a shrewd idea that Leslie’s father might be
responsible for Leslie’s return to New York. She
had heard enough of the conversation between Leslie
and her chaperon on the occasion, when Mrs. Gaylord
had arrived unexpectedly at the Essenden, to
guess that Leslie and her father were not on very
congenial terms.</p>

<p class='c005'>Leslie had left Doris the Dazzler, the white car
she was so fond of driving. She had said nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>in her letter about it, nor had she mentioned the
sum of money which she had placed to Doris’s account
in a Hamilton bank. Doris had not yet been
able to return the seventy-five dollars she had drawn
of the five hundred Leslie had placed in bank to her
credit. She was resolved on doing so before the
close of college in June. Selfishly indifferent and
indifferently selfish though she was she had a certain
standard of honor. She had not ceased to
regret having allowed Leslie to bank the five hundred
dollars to her account.</p>

<p class='c005'>Doris was not so anxious to return the Dazzler
to Leslie. True she had no expectation of keeping
it indefinitely. She hoped, however, that Leslie
would allow her to use it until the close of college.
She was able to pay for its up-keep from her allowance.
Though she cared little for the freshies
and sophs who made much of her, she frequently
took one or more of them with her on her drives
in the white car. Secretly she preferred her own
company to theirs. She regarded them as more or
less “silly” and continued to accept their adoration
with bored sweetness.</p>

<p class='c005'>Unwillingly she had discovered in herself a growing
interest for the Travelers. Her keen perception
could not fail to show her their undeniable claim
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>to originality and cleverness. She admired, even
liked Muriel, to whom she had, however, not spoken
since before Christmas. Before their misunderstanding
she had been on the verge of real fondness for
Muriel. She now missed their former pleasant relation
as roommates. At times she was tempted to
lay aside her grievance and try to restore the old
friendly footing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Leila had approached Doris at the psychological
moment. Doris was weary of being rushed by those
for whom she entertained hardly more than casual
interest. She had not the diversion of Leslie Cairns’
companionship. She had persistently turned “dig”
to the extent of putting herself beyond the immediate
fear of a condition in mathematics. She
was therefore ready to entertain with secret pleasure
Leila’s polite request for her appearance in “The
Knight of the Northern Sun.” She was actually
eager to take the part of Nageda, the Norseland
princess.</p>

<p class='c005'>Outwardly she showed herself as coolly business-like
as Leila during their brief interview. After
she and Leila had separated she experienced a half
sad regret because she appeared to be so thoroughly
“out of it” with clever Miss Harper. She was sure
Miss Harper cared nothing about her personally.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>She merely regarded her as a student; one best
suited to play the part of Nageda.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The Knight of the Northern Sun” was to be
given on the evening of April thirtieth. It would
be presented at least three weeks in advance of
Leila’s Irish play. The Candace Oliver musicale
was to take place on the evening of April fourth.
On the night of April eleventh Leila’s “great idea”
would furnish the entire college body of students
with an evening’s fun.</p>

<p class='c005'>Such was the program the Travelers drew up.
After the meeting came the usual spread, eaten in
high spirits. Marjorie, Robin and Jerry stole
downstairs several minutes after inexorable old ten-thirty
had shrilled its loud emphatic nightly command
for retiring. Very quietly the trio let themselves
out the front door into the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie and Jerry gallantly offered themselves
as Robin’s escorts across the moonlit campus to Silverton
Hall. They took hold of her arms and
paraded her between them, expatiating to her as
they rushed her along at a hiking stride, on the
value of their company. In front of Silverton Hall
they lingered briefly for a last animated exchange
of laughing pleasantries, then Jerry and Marjorie
turned their steps toward the entrance at the east
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>end of the campus which gave on the pike toward
Hamilton Estates.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It seems strange to be walking out of the
campus gates at this time of night.” Marjorie
made this light observation as the two Travelers
stepped from the college premises and out upon
Hamilton Pike.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’re enchanted, you know. We broke the
spell for a little while this evening. There’s the
enchanted trail back to the good fairy’s castle.”
Jerry pointed to the pike, shining and white under
the moon’s clear, burning lamp. “That’s the way
I’ve felt most of the time since we settled ourselves
at the Arms.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So have I. It’s not only Hamilton Arms that
seems enchanted. Hamilton Estates is like a fairy-tale
kingdom,” Marjorie added to Jerry’s fancy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The Kingdom of Castles,” Jerry instantly supplied.
“And in the heart of the kingdom dwelt
Goldendede, a fairy empress.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As they continued on their way to the Arms the
pair amused themselves with the weaving of a fairy
tale about Miss Susanna, Hamilton Estates and
themselves as willing victims of enchantment.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bing! that nearly shattered the enchantment,”
grumbled Jerry as an automobile whisked past them
from the direction in which they had come. “There’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>nothing fairy-like about a buzz-buggy. That particular
one butted into our fairy tale and reu-ined
it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never mind. You’ve been truly inspired since
we left the campus tonight, Jeremiah,” Marjorie
consoled. “Goldendede is a beautiful name for
Miss Susanna. The Kingdom of Castles exactly
suits Hamilton Estates. You couldn’t have named
this aloof collection of turreted gabled houses better.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s higher commendation than you ever gave
the Bean Jingles. It makes up for your sad lack
of appreciation of those gems. I am <i>so</i> mollified,
Bean!” Jerry fairly purred gratification.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’d appreciate your art of jingling more, Jeremiah,
if it were addressed to someone else. Leila
or Ronny or Vera Jingles would be less personal.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have a grudge against your charming self,
Bean,” was Jerry’s retort. “Forget it. Brooke
Hamilton is to be celebrated in biography, why
shouldn’t Marjorie Dean be celebrated in verse.
The first is not greater than the last in her own
little way. The—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Say another word like that and I’ll run off and
leave you in the enchanted dark.” Marjorie placed
a light hand over Jerry’s lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jerry gently removed the restraining fingers and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>gave them a friendly squeeze. She kept Marjorie’s
hand in hers and the two walked on, arms swinging.
“You’re a resplendent goose,” she said, “but
you win. At least you do until the next time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Jerry, did you notice Miss Susanna’s face today
as she stood on the veranda waving to us?”
Marjorie changed the subject with abruptness. “It
was transfigured!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I noticed. I thought then that there could not
be anything quite so wonderful as the return of
happiness to a person who had been shut away
from happiness as long as she had.” Jerry turned
suddenly serious. “And you began it, Marvelous
Manager. You were the leaven—”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie dropped Jerry’s hand and flashed away
from her along the pike, a slim, flitting, shadowy
figure. She was laughing softly to herself as she
ran on for a few yards.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I told you I’d run away from you.” she reminded,
as Jerry came speeding up to her. “I
didn’t propose to stay after hearing myself compared
to a yeast cake.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The two had paused, breathless and laughing at
one side of the pike. Their run had brought them
just beyond the brightly lighted gate posts of Lenox
Heath, a rambling, many gabled English manor
house. Its powerful gate lights illuminated the pike
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>for several hundred feet. Farther ahead of them
it was dark and shadowy, in spite of the full moon’s
rays.</p>

<p class='c005'>A few more steps would bring them to the part
of the highway which skirted the Carden estate,
forming its southern boundary. Formerly the pike
at this point had extended between irregular embankments
of stony earth which rose to a low height
above the pike’s smooth bed. It was at this particular
part of the pike that Miss Susanna had narrowly
escaped being run over by Lillian Walbert’s
car on a February afternoon of the previous year.</p>

<p class='c005'>During the summer which followed the date of
Miss Susanna’s near accident, the right side of the
pike which marked the northern boundary of the
Clements estate had been leveled with the road bed
by order of the Clements themselves. The low
lumpy irregular ridge on the Carden side of the
pike remained, flaunting itself in the face of improvement,
a proof of Carden indifference and obstinacy.
Because of it the Carden house and
grounds appeared even more neglected and unkempt.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s good and dark here in spite of the moon.”
Jerry glanced up at the great arching limbs of the
trees on the Carden side of the pike. A row of
giant elms grew just inside the thick evergreen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>hedge which enclosed the Carden premises and gave
the estate its name. Though still bare of leaves,
the thick interlacing branches of the elms served as
a screen against the moon’s pale radiance.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What a gloomy old dump the Carden estate is!”
was Jerry’s disapproving exclamation. “It looks
like a ghost ranch.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s the Dark Tower in the Kingdom of
Castles.” This time Marjorie did the naming.
“‘Two Travelers to the Dark Tower came,’” she
laughingly misquoted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let’s hope we don’t see the horrors Childe
Roland was supposed to have seen. Goodness
knows <i>what</i> bogie horrified him. I should call
‘Childe Roland’ Browning’s most aggravating
poem. But this eerie spot is no place for a literary
discussion. B-r-r-r! Let’s beat it. I saw a white
ghostly light flash out from behind that old house!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Jerry did not accept her own proposal. Instead
she stopped short, eyes trained on the pale flood of
light. It emanated from a point behind the house
and whitened a space to the left of the gloomy
gray stone dwelling.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here comes your ghost, and in an automobile.”
Marjorie began to laugh. Two white eyes of light
had appeared around the left hand corner of the
house and were rapidly coming down the drive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>toward the watchers. “‘Two goslings to the Dark
Tower came—and saw a gasoline ghost,’” she
mocked.</p>

<p class='c005'>The watchers came abreast of the entrance gateway
of the estate just as the car reached it. By
its light they saw that the gates stood open. They
hurried past them and drew close to the uneven
ridge of earth in order to allow the automobile
plenty of room to turn onto the pike. Instead of
driving on, the solitary occupant stopped the
machine at the edge of the pike just clear of the
gateway.</p>

<p class='c005'>The machine itself was a long, rakish-looking
racing car. Its driver was a tall man, very broad
of shoulder. He wore a long dark motor coat.
A leather motor cap was pulled down over his forehead.
Intent on his own affairs, he did not glance
toward the two young women. He sprang from
the racer and strode back to close the gates. He
slammed them shut with an air which indicated
proprietorship. Two or three long steps and he
had returned to his car. He leaped into it, started
it and was gone almost instantly around the curve
of the pike which was the last outpost of the Carden
estate. Just on the other side of it the estate
of Hamilton Arms began.</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i>Some ghost.</i> That’s the first time I ever saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>anyone emerge from that gloom patch, day or night.
Now who do you suppose he was? If he’s a visitor
at Carden Hedge he must be visiting either himself
or spooks. Maybe he’s a Carden. Not that I care
a hoot who he is, but one must have something to
say about everyone.” Jerry left the rough ground
on which the two had been standing for the smoothness
of the pike. “Come along, Bean. It will be
midnight before we hit the castle,” she predicted.
“Ronny was right about this pair of Travelers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wonder if he was one of the Cardens?” Marjorie’s
question contained a certain amount of curiosity.
Since she had taken up the work of arranging
the data for Brooke Hamilton’s biography
she had found enough allusions to the Carden family
to give her a clear idea of what a thorn Alec
Carden had been to Brooke Hamilton’s flesh.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He may be the son of Alec Carden. I mean the
son who inherited Carden Hedge,” she continued
musingly. “This man in the racer wasn’t young.
I caught a fair view of his face in spite of the way
he had his cap pulled down. Still he may be
younger than I thought him at a glance, and the
grandson of old Alec Carden.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why worry about it?” teased Jerry. She had
caught the note of puzzled interest in Marjorie’s
voice.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“I’m not worrying. I’m wondering why that
man’s face looked so familiar. I’m sure I never
saw him before.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How can he look familiar to you if you’ve never
before seen him?” inquired Jerry, with a chuckle.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s precisely what I’m wondering. Perhaps
he resembles some one I know or have seen. I
must ask Miss Susanna to describe John Carden,
the son who lives at the Hedge. Here we are at
our own castle. Next time we mustn’t stay out
so late, Jeremiah. I hope Miss Susanna hasn’t
stayed up to wait for us. She likes her early bedtime,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Susanna had elected to “stay up” to hear
about Leila’s “great” idea. They found her waiting
for them in the library, wrapped in a trailing blue
velvet dressing gown. She hustled them upstairs
to don negligees and ordered them down to
the library when they should have changed costume.
There she brought them two little Chinese bowls
of chicken consommé and a plate of salty crackers.</p>

<p class='c005'>Both girls had eaten sparingly of the spread.
After their moonlight walk they were really hungry,
and the consommé was delicious. As they ate it
and nibbled the crisp crackers they regaled Miss
Susanna with a lively account of the evening’s happenings.
Interest in the Travelers’ new plans for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>entertainments drove the incident of the unknown
motorist completely from Marjorie’s mind. Nor
did she think of him again for some time afterward.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <br />A RETURN TO A FORBIDDEN LAND</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Leslie, is it really you? I’d been wondering
why you hadn’t answered my letter. I wrote you
soon after I received your note.” Doris Monroe’s
indifferent drawl was not in evidence as she
answered the telephone. She was surprised and
more pleased than she had thought she could
possibly be to hear Leslie Cairns’ voice on the wire.
Leslie’s arrival in Hamilton meant an immediate
brightening of the bored existence Doris had been
leading since her return from New York.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wrote you I’d surely be here in April,” Leslie
brusquely reminded, “and here I am.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m <i>awfully</i> glad of it.” Doris spoke with
pleasing sincerity. “Is Mrs. Gaylord with you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ye-es.” Leslie drawled the affirmation with
exaggerated weariness. “How she does wish she
wasn’t. She nearly had a conniption when I told
her we were going to make a flying trip to Hamilton.
I’ll meet you at the Colonial at four this
P. M. You’ll hear more of my history then.
Bye.” Leslie was gone.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Doris’s beautiful face was a study as she turned
from the telephone. She was a trifle amazed at her
distinct pleasure in Leslie’s unexpected arrival at
Hamilton. Leslie had been so moodily unbearable
after their return from the holiday vacation which
they had spent in New York, Doris had felt relieved
at the former’s sudden disappearance from
Hamilton and the subsequent receipt of Leslie’s
brief note from New York.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was only recently that she had begun to miss
Leslie and wish for her society. In spite of her
ugly moods Leslie was possessed of an originality
which Doris found singularly enlivening. No one
could say more oddly funny things than Leslie when
she chose to be humorous. Leslie never hesitated
to pay extravagantly for whatever she happened to
want. Doris admired in her what she considered
Leslie’s “adventurous spirit.” She had been
brought up to know her father’s explorer friends.
They were hardy, intrepid world wanderers of daring.
She had listened to their tales of reckless adventuring
into the unknown and gloried in the doings
of these splendid captains of adventure. There
were occasions when it appeared to her that Leslie
showed something of the same adventurous, undaunted
spirit.</p>

<p class='c005'>As a matter of truth, Leslie was animated by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>this very spirit. She had directed it, however, into
ignoble channels. What she chose to regard as
strategy and daring were nothing other than trickery
and lawlessness.</p>

<p class='c005'>Doris knew little or nothing of Leslie’s flagrant
offenses as a student at Hamilton College. She
had learned of the latter’s expellment from college
from Leslie herself. She had consequently
never heard the rights of the affair. She had
heard vague stories concerning it from Julia Peyton,
Clara Carter and one or two juniors. The
knowledge of Leslie’s immense wealth had hampered
even their gossip about the ex-student. The
freshmen and the sophomores, who were Doris’s
chief companions, had entered Hamilton too late
to be on the campus at the period before Leslie’s
and her chums’ expulsion from college. They,
therefore, knew not much about her.</p>

<p class='c005'>The present junior and senior classes had been
respectively the freshman and sophomore classes
during Leslie’s senior year at Hamilton, which had
been also the year of her expulsion from college.
At that particular time the attitude of the two lower
classes had been one of horrified disapproval of the
seventeen San Soucians who had been expelled
from Hamliton for hazing a student. That was
almost as much as any of them had ever learned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>about the affair. The girls who knew the disagreeable
truth were Marjorie Dean and her intimates.
Silence with them was honor. They knew a great
many other derogatory facts about Leslie Cairns
and her methods which they kept strictly sub rosa.</p>

<p class='c005'>Doris was ready to welcome Leslie with warmth.
She sorely lacked companions of interest. She had
begun to grow bored to satiety by admiration. The
freshies’ and sophs’ adoration for her was too
superficial to be satisfying. They enjoyed rushing
the college beauty. Each class liked to parade her
on the campus and fête her at Baretti’s, the Colonial
or at their pet Hamilton tea shops as a triumphant
class trophy. She was selfish, but not shallow;
indifferent, but not vapid. It was in her composition
to give as well as receive. Because she had
been surfeited with adulation she had lately experienced
a vague unrestful desire to turn from the
knowledge of her own charms to an admiration of
some one else.</p>

<p class='c005'>First among the students of Hamilton she admired
Leila Harper. Robin Page was her second
“crush.” Muriel made a third in a trio which had
won her difficult fancy. None of these, however,
were likely to become her friends. She would never
make overtures to them. She was confident that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>they would never make further friendly advances
to her.</p>

<p class='c005'>Such a state of mind on her part augured a hearty
welcome for Leslie. Doris hurried to her room
after her last afternoon class, hastily got into the
new fawn English walking suit, recently arrived
from a Bond Street shop, and made a buoyant exit
from the Hall and to the garage for the white car.
It was a clear, sunshiny day. She thought Leslie
might like to take a ride in the Dazzler. Leslie
had probably hired a taxicab in which to come from
town to the Colonial.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was a very short distance from the garage to
the Colonial. Arrived there, Doris saw a solitary
car parked in front of the restaurant. It was a
black roadster of newest type and most expensive
make. She jumped to an instant conclusion that it
must belong to Leslie.</p>

<p class='c005'>Doris parked the Dazzler behind the roadster and
went into the tea room to meet Leslie. She found
her seated at one of the several square mission oak
tables engaged in a languid perusal of a menu card.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How are you, Goldie? Have a seat at the table
and a bite with yours truly.” Leslie waved Doris
into the chair opposite her. Then she stretched an
arm lazily across the table and offered Doris her
hand.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“Very well, thank you, Leslie. How have you
been getting along?” Doris returned, with only a
shade of her usual drawl. “I <i>am</i> glad to see you.
I have missed you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A good miss.” Leslie shrugged an accompaniment
to her laconic comment. “Were you surprised
to hear me on the ’phone?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course. I was surprised when you wrote me
from New York. I had no idea you had left Hamilton.
I was afraid of being conditioned in math.
I was studying like mad and hadn’t time just then
to call you on the telephone at the hotel. I knew
you were very busy.” So far as she went Doris
was truthful.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, forget it. I believe what you say, Goldie,
but you might have added that you were all fed
up with me. I know I had a beastly grouch after
the New York trip. It had teeth and claws. I had
business trouble. That sneaking carpenter who is
trying to swing the dormitory job for Bean and
her precious Beanstalks coaxed all my men over to
the Beggar Ranch. He told them a lot of fairy
stories, I suppose. Anyway, I had to send for one
of my father’s best men, an Italian financier, who
understands Italian peasants. Even he couldn’t
undo the mischief that scamp, Graham, had done.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I finally had to send for my father. He fired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>the whole shooting match. I’m done with that
garage flivver. My father said it wouldn’t pay me
very well in the end. He was sore at me for wasting
my time around this burg. He tried to make
me promise I’d go to New York and never think
about Hamilton again. He can’t stand the college
since the precious Board gave me such an unfair
deal.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, that’s dreadful, Leslie; about your garage
I mean.” Doris had a certain amount of sympathy
for Leslie. She was not specially interested
in business, but she decided that Leslie had been
badly treated.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll say it is,” Leslie made grim response. “Oh,
never mind. I’m still worth a few dollars. Did
you see my new car out in front?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes—I had an idea that car must belong to
you. It suggested you to me at first sight.” Doris
smiled across the table at her returned friend. “I
had no idea you’d have a car. I brought the Dazzler
on purpose. I thought we might like to take
a ride.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gaylord and I came here from New York in
that car,” Leslie informed with an inflection of
pride. “My father doesn’t know I’m here. He
sailed for Europe last Thursday. I know positively
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>that he went, too. I was at the dock and saw his
steamer cut loose from Manhattan.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Were you?” Doris exhibited her usual polite
reticence regarding Leslie’s father. Long since she
had discovered that Leslie did not like to answer
questions about him. “It is rather a long drive
from New York, isn’t it. Your motor coat and
hat are chic.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So is your suit. I suppose it floated straight
across the pond to you. My coat came from the
Clayham, in New York. But it’s some bang-up
English shop, now let me tell you.” Leslie showed
brightening satisfaction of her own greenish-gray
motor coat and round hat of the same material.</p>

<p class='c005'>Leslie’s own remarks about her father were
“fairy stories” so far as her having seen him entered
into them. She had not seen him, nor had
she received any letters from him other than the
peremptory one in which he had scathingly reprimanded
her and ordered her to New York.
Nevertheless she <i>had</i> seen him sail for Europe in
the “<i>Arcadia</i>,” though he had not known of her
presence on the dock when the steamer cleared.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had gone to the dock in a cheap tan rain-coat,
a red worsted Tam o’Shanter cap and a pair
of shell-rimmed glasses. Mingling with the crowd
on the dock she was confident her disguise was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>effective. Her father’s manager, Mr. Carrington,
had furnished her with the information of the date
and hour of her father’s departure for Europe. She
had not seen him since the day when she had called
at her father’s offices. Neither had he seen her
father for more than a few minutes at a time
during which no mention of Leslie had been made.
He had been led by her to believe that she had
planned a pleasant steamer surprise for her father.
He had therefore kept his own counsel and his
promise to Leslie. He had sent her a note to the
Essenden which had been duly forwarded to her
new address.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should think you’d rather be in New York than
here.” Doris gave a half envious sigh. “There’s
nothing here of interest off the campus.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I had to come here while Peter the Great
was away.” Leslie volunteered this much of an explanation
of her visit. “I must get a line on what
was done on the garage so I’ll know just how
much money I put into it. My father will want to
know that right off the bat if he offers it for sale
as it stands. You and I will have some bully rides
and drives while I’m here, Goldie. I shan’t be such
a grouch as I was right after Christmas. How are
things at the knowledge shop? How is Bean?
Had any fusses with her or her Beanstalks lately?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Leslie’s expression grew lowering as she mentioned
Marjorie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Dean and Miss Macy aren’t at Wayland
Hall now. They’re staying at Hamilton Arms.
I don’t know whether they are coming back to
the Hall again or not.” Doris had expected the
information might elicit surprise from her companion.
She smiled in faint amusement of Leslie’s
astonished features, then added the crowning
bit of news. “Miss Dean was chosen by Miss
Hamilton to write Brooke Hamilton’s biography.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <br />A WILD PLAN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“What-t? Do you know what you’re saying?”
Leslie’s tones rose higher.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ought to know. I’ve heard nothing else since
she left the Hall for Hamilton Arms.” Doris’s
tone was the acme of weariness. “It wouldn’t have
been surprising to hear that President Matthews
had been asked to write Brooke Hamilton’s biography,”
she continued. “The idea of <i>Miss Dean</i>
as his biographer is, well—<i>ridiculous</i>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s pure bosh,” Leslie said contemptuously.
“She’s a tricky little hypocrite. She’s managed to
curry favor with that wizened old frump at Hamilton
Arms. The last of the Hamiltons! She looks
it. I heard when I was at Hamilton that she was
sore at the college; that she had all the dope for
Brooke Hamilton’s biography but wouldn’t come
across with it. I presume Bean slathered her with
deceitful sweetness until she grew dizzy with her
own importance and renigged.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t like Miss Dean.” Doris’s fair face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>clouded. “I’m glad she’s not at the Hall any
longer. Miss Harper and her other friends don’t
appear to miss her much, or Miss Macy either.
They have parties in one another’s rooms almost
every night.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They have found they can live without her,”
was Leslie’s satiric opinion. “You certainly have
handed me news, Goldie.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, that’s only a beginning,” Doris declared,
well pleased with Leslie’s appreciation. “The
other night Miss Dean and Miss Macy were at
the Hall to dinner. Afterward they were in Miss
Harper’s room with their crowd. They had a high
old time talking and laughing. I could hear them,
but not very plainly. They were planning shows,
though. Since then a notice for a piano recital,
featuring Candace Oliver, a freshie musical genius,
has appeared on all the bulletin boards. Since that
notice there has come another of an Irish play by
Miss Harper. It’s to be given in May. The name
of the play and the cast hasn’t yet been announced.
Miss Harper is awfully tantalizing. She always
waits until campus curiosity is at fever height about
her plays before she gives out any more information.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She’s a foxy proposition.” Leslie showed signs
of growing sulkiness. Her earlier affability had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>begun to wane at first mention of Marjorie Dean.
Next to Marjorie, Leila Harper was registered in
her black books.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She’s clever, Leslie; not foxy,” Doris calmly
corrected. She went on to tell Leslie of the part
Leila had asked her to play in “The Knight of the
Northern Sun.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Leslie’s deep-rooted jealousy of the two girls
who were college successes where she had been
a rank failure rushed to the surface. “Leila Harper
has nerve to ask you to be in a play when she knows
you are a friend of mine. I see her game. She
knows just how useful you can be to her in her
confounded old play. It’s some feather in her
theatre bonnet to keep the college beauty at her
beck and call. She has planned to break up our
friendship by flattering you into believing you are
a dramatic wonder. Bean is probably back of
Harper’s scheme. She can’t and never could bear
to see me enjoy myself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Leslie jerked out the final sentence of her tirade
against Leila with angry force. Her face had darkened
in the jealous way which invariably reminded
Doris of the driving of thunder clouds across a
graying sky.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Harper was impersonal in asking me to
be in the play,” Doris defended. The sea shell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>pink in her cheeks had deepened perceptibly. “She
dislikes me. I know she wants me in the cast because
she thinks I’d be a feature. You see I’m the
true Norse type. The heroine of the play is a
Norse princess. I want to be in the play because
I like to be in things. I’ll enjoy the praise and
the excitement. I may go on the English stage
when I have been graduated from Hamilton. My
father would not object if I were to play in a high
class London company.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The same old Goldie who cares for nobody but
herself.” Leslie gave vent to a sarcastic little
snicker. “Why not take up with Bean, too?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Leslie, don’t be hateful,” Doris said with
an air of resigned patience. “You know I detest
Miss Dean. Nothing could induce me to take up
with her. It’s different with Miss Harper. She’s
not American, you know. She is so cosmopolitan
in manner. She is really more my own style. But,
of course, she’s hopelessly devoted to that Sanford
crowd of girls.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t mention Sanford to me. I hate the name
of that collection of one-story huts,” Leslie exploded
fiercely. “You ought to detest Bean, considering
the way she has treated me. If she had
been half as square as she pretends to be she would
have put the kibosh on old Graham, just like that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>when he began hiring my men away from my architects.
My father said the whole business was a
disgrace. He said there was no use in my trying
to buck against an institution. That’s what Bean’s
pull amounts to. She has both Prexy and that
ancient Hamilton relict to back her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If Miss Dean knew that her architect was hiring
your men away from your architects, and ignored
the fact for her own business interests then
she must be thoroughly dishonorable,” Doris said
flatly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If—if—There you go,” sputtered Leslie, wagging
her head, her shaggy eye-brows drawn together.
“No ‘if’ about it. She knew. You talk
as though you wanted to believe her honorable.
Well, she isn’t, never was; never will be. It makes
me furious to think that she should go nipping
around the campus as a college arc light while I
wasn’t even allowed a look at a sheepskin. Too
bad I couldn’t have learned some of her pretty little
dodges. I’d have been able to slide out of the hazing
racket. I’ll tell you something you don’t know.
Bean could have helped us when the Board sent for
her by refusing to go to Hamilton Hall to the inquiry.
Not Bean. She went, and made such a fuss
about pretending she didn’t care to talk that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>made us appear ten times as much to blame as we
really were.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If—” Doris hastily checked herself. “She
seems to have tried her best to down you, Leslie.
But, why?” Her green eyes directed themselves
upon Leslie with a disconcerting steadiness.</p>

<p class='c005'>Leslie gave a short laugh. “I used to ask myself
that,” she replied with a sarcastic straightening of
her lips. “Now I understand her better. She was
jealous and wanted to be the whole show, all the
time. She is deep as a well. Take my word for
it. I know her better than I wish I knew her.”
She shook her head with slow effective regret.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll surely remember what you’ve said about
her.” Doris meant what she said. She had been
distinctly shocked at both instances which Leslie
had cited of Marjorie Dean’s treachery. What she
desired most now was that Leslie should drop the
discussion of her grievances.</p>

<p class='c005'>This Leslie was not ready to do. She continued
on the depressing topic for several more minutes.
Then she began asking Doris questions concerning
the subject of Brooke Hamilton’s biography. Doris
knew only what she had already imparted to Leslie
concerning it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“None of the students know the details concerning
it except Miss—I mean, the Travelers,” she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>finally said desperately. She stopped short of mentioning
Marjorie’s name again. She did not care
to start Leslie anew. “I imagine there really isn’t
much else to know besides what I’ve already told
you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t you ever believe it,” was the skeptical
retort. “But I don’t blame you, Goldie, for what
you don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you.” Doris shrugged satiric gratitude.
Glad to turn the conversation into a lighter
strain she continued gaily: “We’re soon going to
have a general lark on the campus. The whole
college crowd is to be in it. It’s to be a ‘Rustic
Romp.’ One-half of the girls are to dress up as
country maids; the other half as country swains.
In order to be sure of an even number of couples
each student has to register her choice as maid or
swain. If not enough girls register as swains then
some of the maids will have to change their minds
and do duty as gallants. Miss Evans, a rather nice
senior, has charge of the registration. And it’s to
be a masquerade!” Doris’s exclamation contained
pleased anticipation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wonderful.” Leslie chose to be derisive.
Underneath envious interest prompted her to ask;
“Whose fond, fertile flight of foolishness was that?
Mickie Harper’s or Pudge and Beans?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>“I don’t know whose inspiration it was. Probably
the seniors had the most to do with it.” Doris
again steered the talk toward peaceful channels.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hm-m.” Leslie glanced at Doris, then at the
luncheon which the waitress was now placing before
them on the table. She gazed abstractedly at
the appetizing repast. Her eyes traveled slowly
back to Doris. Suddenly she broke into one of her
fits of silent, hob-goblin merriment. “I think I’ll
attend that hayseed carnival myself,” she announced
in a tone of defiant boldness.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <br />CLAIMING A PROMISE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“What do you mean?” Slightly mystified for
an instant it then broke upon Doris that Leslie was
in earnest. She was actually entertaining a wild
idea of attending the coming romp behind the
shelter of a mask. “You couldn’t do that—er—it
would be—unwise,” she stammered. Dismay
flashed into her green eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why couldn’t I?” The question vibrated with
obstinacy. “Who except you would know me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“U-m-m; no one would know you while you
were masked, I suppose. When it came time to
unmask—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’d not be in the gym at unmasking time,”
Leslie interrupted decisively. “I’d be out of that
barn and away before the signal came to unmask.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Doris eyed Leslie doubtfully. Her first shock
of dismay at the announcement had subsided. She
was still swayed by caution as she said slowly: “It
would be awfully risky for you. At the Valentine
masquerade no one knew when the call to unmask
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>was coming. That’s the way it will be at the
romp.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“At the Valentine masquerade when <i>I</i> was at
Hamilton the time for unmasking was nine-thirty.”
The corners of Leslie’s wide mouth took on an ugly
droop.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know that is the way it used to be,” Doris
hastily re-assured. “At the last masquerade the
freshies asked the junior committee to make the
unmasking time a surprise. It proved to be a lot of
fun. It will be done again this time. I’m almost
sure it will.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What if it should be? Don’t imagine that I
can’t watch my step. I’d not be caught.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suppose you were dancing when the call to unmask
came? You’d have to leave your partner
instantly and run like a deer for the door. Suppose
you were caught on the way to the door and
unmasked by a crowd of girls? The freshies are
terrors at that sort of thing. They are always out
for tom-boy fun. You’d not care to have such
an embarrassing thing happen to you.” Doris chose
to present to Leslie a plain supposition of what
might happen to her as an uninvited masker at the
romp.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Leave it to me to make a clever get-away,” was
Leslie’s boast. “I’d be safe for five or six dances.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>That would be as long as I’d care to stay in the
gym. It’s wearing a hayrick costume that strikes
me as having some pep to it. The adventure of
breaking into the knowledge shop and enjoying myself
under the noses of Prigville, without any of
the inhabitants knowing who I am, appeals to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Unwittingly she had appealed to the side of Doris
most in sympathy with her bold plan. Doris had
been born and bred to understanding and approval
of adventure. “I understand the way you feel about
it, Leslie,” she began. “If I were certain that—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, forget that I mentioned dressing up to
you!” Leslie exclaimed with savage impatience.
“You’ve said more than once that you’d be pleased
to do anything you could for me, <i>at any time</i>.
I thought you would help me a little to play this
joke on Prigville. Never mind. I’ll ask only one
thing of you. If you <i>should</i> happen to recognize
me on the night of the haytime hobble, kindly don’t
publish it among the prigs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Leslie.” Doris put dignified reproach into the
response. “You know I would never betray you.
I’m perfectly willing to help you carry out your
plan, provided there’s no danger to either of us in
it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Danger of what?” came the sarcastic question.
“No danger to you. Let me do a little supposing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Suppose we went together to the gym; you as a
maid, and I as your swain. Suppose I failed to
make a get-away and was unmasked by a bunch
of smart Alecs. I’d probably not be near you when
the signal came to unmask. I’d not bother you
after the grand march. There’d be so many hey
Rubes in the gym no one would remember our
coming in together. That lets you out, doesn’t it?
You should falter. Have a heart, Goldie!” Leslie
had grown satirically persuasive.</p>

<p class='c005'>Doris sat studying the situation in silence. She
had colored afresh at Leslie’s pointed inference that
she was more concerned for her own security from
possible mishap at the romp than for that of Leslie
herself. She hated the sarcastic reminder flung
at her by Leslie that she had promised a favor on
demand and was now not willing to keep her word.
As Leslie had presented the situation to her there
could be no risk to her. Leslie was more than able
to look out for her own interests. To help Leslie
now meant not only the keeping of her promise. It
was a singularly easy way of keeping it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’d rather you’d turn me down now than next
year,” Leslie sneered as Doris continued silent.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll help you, Leslie.” Doris spoke stiffly, ignoring
her disgruntled companion’s sneer.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come again.” Leslie cupped an ear with her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>hand, mockery in the gesture, but triumph in her
small dark eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I said I would help you.” Doris repeated her
first statement in an even stiffer tone. She would
not permit Leslie to break down her poise.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good for you. You won’t be sorry. Help me
to put over this stunt on Prigville and I’ll give you
the Dazzler for your own.” Leslie was buoyantly
generous in her delight at having gained her own way.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t want any such reward. That’s just
the trouble with you, Leslie. You are always offering
me so much more than I can ever return.
I wish you were going to the dance, to stay all
evening and have a good time with the others.”
Doris sincerely meant the wish.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You know whose fault it is that I can’t.” Leslie
shrugged significantly. “Now I must plan my
costume.” She straightened in her chair with a
faint sigh. “I’ll sport blue overalls, a brown and
red gingham shirt, large plaid, with no collar; a
turkey-red cotton hankie, a big floppy hayseed hat
and a striped umbrella.” She chuckled as she enumerated
these items of costume.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I had thought seriously of going as a swain, but
decided against it. I’d rather look pretty. I have
a certain reputation to keep up on the campus. I’d
prefer not to caricature myself.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“You make me smile, Goldie. How you worship
that precious beauty reputation of yours! You
may be right about it. I presume you are.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Leslie’s rugged face grew momentarily downcast.
She was thinking morosely that if, like Doris,
she had been half as careful in whom she trusted and
to what risks she lent herself when at Hamilton she
might have escaped disgrace.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know I am.” Doris was emphatical. She
noted the gloomy change in Leslie’s features and
understood partly what had occasioned it. Those
four words, “I presume you are,” made more impression
on Doris than any other reference to her
college trouble or against Marjorie Dean, which
she had ever before heard Leslie make. It held a
compelling, resigned inference of unfair treatment
at the hands of others. Those others were of
course Miss Dean and her friends. Doris allowed
herself to jump to that conclusion. She had fostered
jealous disdain of Marjorie until it had become
antipathy. She knew Leslie’s faults, but she
chose to overlook them. She had sometimes regarded
Leslie’s accusations against “Bean” as overdrawn.
Now she felt more in sympathy with Leslie’s
standing grudge against Marjorie Dean than
at any time since she had known Leslie.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <br />A RUSTIC DISASTER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The evening of April eleventh saw Hamilton
campus in the possession of a social throng, large,
rural and hilarious. The spring twilight was scarcely
ready to drop faint lavender shades over departed
day when from the various student houses on the
big green issued veritable country bumpkins in festival
attire. They appeared singly, in twos, threes,
quartettes and straggling groups.</p>

<p class='c005'>Fortunately for the rovingly-inclined bands of
rural pleasure-seekers the night was warm and
balmy. In the mild fragrant spring air, the giggling
maids flaunted their bright calicos and ginghams,
unhidden in their cotton glory by shawl, coat
or cape.</p>

<p class='c005'>The gallant swains who dotingly accompanied
the flower-hatted or sun-bonneted, aproned ladies
were a sturdy, rugged-looking lot in their blue or
brown overalls, flannel or gingham shirts, brilliant
cotton neck handkerchiefs and wide-brimmed straw
field hats or weather-stained sombreros. A few ambitious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>rustic youths had appeared in their own
fond weird conception of party attire. They were
amazing and wonderful to behold.</p>

<p class='c005'>“These happy hecks at Hamilton certainly have
small feet,” remarked a stocky rustic in a faded
pink gingham shirt, a blue and white checked overall,
broad, square-toed low shoes, a bright green
neckerchief and a narrow-rimmed, round straw hat
with a hole in the crown through which a lock of
brown hair appeared, standing straight up. The
accompanying mask was a round false face with
very red cheeks and high arching brows.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, they can’t help it. If they hide ’em with
brogans how can they dance with the lady hecks?”
demanded a tall bumpkin in what he was now
proudly exhibiting on the campus as “my horse
clothes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Te, he he,” giggled the stocky rustic. “Truly,
Muriel Harding, I never saw you look so funny
before in all my life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sh-h-h, Jeremiah. I don’t know how you knew
me. Since you do, keep it dark. Some horse
clothes! Have one of my cards.” Muriel handed
Jerry a correspondence card in a violent shade of
pink. In the center of it was written: “Horsefield
Hanks, Jockey and Post Master, Jayville.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Jerry continued to giggle at Horsefield Hanks’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>gala adornment. It consisted of a bright blue flannel
shirt, a broad red leather belt, baggy brown
trousers tucked into a pair of boot-modeled goloshes,
a rusty black cutaway coat and a red and
white striped jockey cap with a wide front peak.
The mask was a false face of particularly ferocious
expression. To look at Horsefield Hanks was not
only to laugh. It was a signal to keep on laughing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where is Marjorie?” Muriel inquired as she
turned from bending a killing glance upon two
hurrying maids, evidently intent on joining their
swains. The two called a mirthful: “Hello, sweetness.
Where did your face grow?” and whisked
on their way.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gone over to the Hall to meet Robin. She
has on a fine check yellow and white gingham dress
trimmed with little yellow ruffles, white stockings
and slippers and a white ruffled organdie hat with
long yellow ribbon strings.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll certainly know her if I see her. Vera is too
cute for words. She has two overalls on, one over
the other, to make her look fat. They’re blue and
her blouse is white. She has a black alpaca coat on,
too. She managed to get hold of a funny little
pair of copper-toed boots. She has built them up
inside until she is at least three inches taller. She
won’t be easily recognized.” Muriel rattled off the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>description in a low laughing voice. “Ronny has
on a pale blue calico. It comes down to her heels.
She has black slippers and stockings, a ruffled blue
sunbonnet and a white kerchief folded across her
shoulders. Lucy’s dressed in the same style except
her dress is lavender. Leila is a maid, but I
haven’t been able to pick her out yet. Now how in
the world did you know that I was I?” Muriel
demanded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I knew the most ridiculous costume I saw would
be yours,” chuckled Jerry. “You’re so funny, you’re
positively idiotic.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then I’m likely to win the prize for having the
funniest costume. Won’t that be nice? Come on,
Hayfoot, that’s what you look like. Let’s go out
in the world and hunt up Strawfoot. I presume
we’ll be mobbed before we’ve gone far for not
having our rustic maids along with us. Anyhow
let’s brave the jays and jayesses as long as we can.”
Muriel politely offered Jerry an arm. “I’m to meet
Candace Oliver at seven-thirty at the Bean holder.
I’m a gentleman jockey of leisure until then. The
post office was closed early today. Jayville will
have to wait for its mail.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The gallant pair had not proceeded fifty feet
from their reconnoitering place before they were
surrounded by a crowd of swains and maids and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>rushed over the green as prisoners to be apportioned
to the first two swainless maids the company
chanced to encounter.</p>

<p class='c005'>Meanwhile a rustic gentleman in wearing apparel
becoming to one of his lowly station had just made
a very stealthy entrance to the campus from the
extreme eastern gates. He had cautiously stepped
from a smart black roadster which was parked a
little way from the gates, but well off the highway.
Before he had ventured to step from the car he had
left the steering seat and disappeared into the tonneau
of the machine, then simply a motorist in a
voluminous leather motor coat, goggles and a
leather cap.</p>

<p class='c005'>From the back of the car had presently emerged
a typical jay in blue overalls, and a loud-plaided,
collarless, gingham shirt of green, blue and
red mixture. He wore a turkey-red handkerchief,
knotted about the neck, an immense flopping hat
of yellowish straw, white socks and carpet slippers
with worsted embroidered fronts. In one hand he
clutched firmly a huge red and yellow striped umbrella.
The mask, which Leslie had ordered sent
to her from New York, was a very pink and white
face, utterly insipid, with three flat golden curls
pasted on the low forehead. Its expression, one of
cheerful idiocy, was as distinctly as mirth-inspiring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>as was the fierce face of Horsefield Hanks. In fact
it would have been hard to decide which of the two
get-ups was the funnier.</p>

<p class='c005'>One swift glance about her to assure herself of
a clear coast and Leslie made a dash for the campus
gates. She was through the gateway in a twinkling.
She did not stop until she had put a little distance
between herself and the gates. Then she paused,
turned, critically surveyed the highway, the portion
of the campus immediate to her and lastly her car.
She was hardly content to leave it there, but there
was no other way. It was well out of the path of
other machines, either coming or going on the pike.
She could but hope that no one would make off with
it. She reflected with a wry smile that there were
still a few more cars to be bought, though she might
happen to lose that one. As usual she was prepared
to pay lavishly for her fun.</p>

<p class='c005'>She hurried straight on across the campus past
Silverton Hall and in the direction of Acasia House.
It was the most remote from the gymnasium of all
the campus houses. She and Doris had agreed to
meet there, making the appointment late enough
to miss Acasia House rustics when they should set
out for the gymnasium. Doris had telephoned her
that afternoon and made the final arrangement for
their rendezvous. They were to meet behind a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>huge clump of lilac bushes just budding into leaf.</p>

<p class='c005'>As she came abreast of the lilac bushes a dainty
figure in white dimity, imprinted with bunches of
violets stepped forth to meet her. Doris’s charming
frock had a wide dimity sash and her dimity
hat, trimmed with bunches of silk violets, had long
violet ribbon strings. She wore flat-heeled black
kid slippers and white silk stockings of which only
a glimpse showed beneath her long gown.</p>

<p class='c005'>One look at Leslie’s inane false face and she
burst into laughter. “Such a face!” she gasped
mirthfully. “The funniest one I’ve seen since I
left the Hall tonight.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Leslie lifted the spreading hat and disclosed to
Doris a yellow wig which matched the curls pasted
to her mask. “My face is my fortune,” she announced
humorously.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s too funny for words. I’m almost afraid we
may be rushed.” Doris cast an anxious glance at
the not far distant crowd.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Am I so funny as all that?” Leslie asked in
gratification.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are quite extraordinarily funny,” Doris
assured. “The crowd on the campus has been going
it strong ever since dinner. They’re awfully
frisky. Once they get into the gym they’ll be wanting
to dance. Then we won’t be in danger. There’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>to be a prize given for the funniest costume. Too
bad you can’t stay in the gym long enough to win
it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I don’t want it. I only want a little fun,”
Leslie said.</p>

<p class='c005'>Warily the pair skirted the crowd and went on
to the gymnasium. Leslie’s funny face immediately
challenged the attention of a number of frisky
couples parading the great room. They began
flocking about herself and Doris, asking foolish
questions in a gleeful effort to learn her identity.
She remained mute for which Doris was thankful.
Her vacant smiling mask merely continued to beam
upon her hilarious questioners.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Hamtown Gilt Medal Band and Orkestry
were already in their corner, importantly ensconced
behind a white pasteboard picket fence. They alone
of the ruralites were unmasked. They were simple
geniuses of music in overalls, gay-checked shirts
and high-crowned haying hats of rough straw,
speckled green and red. Strings of richly gilded
pasteboard medals struggled across each musician’s
manly chest; they testified eloquently of past musical
achievement. A large gilt-lettered sign, high on a
standard flaunted the proud legend: “We have won
all the medals in Hamtown for the past forty years.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>The only other band was a hand organ. Notice
our decorations.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The leader and first violin of this renowned
group of musicians was tall and rather blonde,
with an imposing blonde goatee and an artistic
sweep of curled blonde mustache. His companion
players were hardly less well supplied with whiskers,
mustaches and even side burns. In direct apposition
to the rustic youths of the community of
Hamtown they presented a decidedly mature, dignified
appearance. They seemed complacently well
aware of their musical superiority over their
humbler companions and gave themselves plenty of
airs.</p>

<p class='c005'>At intervals about the spacious gym were little
open booths where popcorn fritters, salted peanuts,
stick candy, apples and oranges, molasses taffy and
pink lemonade were sold. In each booth a masked
rustic maid presided, keeping a lynx eye on her
wares.</p>

<p class='c005'>After the orchestra had tuned up with considerable
scraping, sawing and tooting they burst into
the rallying strains of the grand march. Doris
heard the sound of the music with patent relief.
She had grown more and more uneasy for fear that
Leslie might forget her role of silence and blurt
out a remark in her characteristic fashion. Anyone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>who had known her in the past would be likely to
recognize her voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>Doris had suggested that it would be better for
they two to dance together the few numbers before
the unmasking for which Leslie dared remain.
To this Leslie would not hear. She craved freedom
to roam about the gymnasium by herself and
dance with whom she fancied. She and Doris
walked through the grand march together and
danced the first number. Then Leslie left Doris,
who was being singled out by two or three husky
farmer boys for attention, and strolled down the
gymnasium, her striped umbrella under one arm.</p>

<p class='c005'>Behind the fatuously-smiling blonde face her
small dark eyes were keeping a bright watch on
the revelers. She wondered where Bean and her
Beanstalks were and tried to pick them out by
height and figure. She decided that a maid in a
pale pink lawn frock was Marjorie and promptly
kept away from her. When the music for the second
dance began she made her bow to a slim sprite in
fluffy white who accepted with a genuine freshie
giggle.</p>

<p class='c005'>Encouraged by her success as a beau Leslie
danced the next and still the next, each time with
a different partner. She was a good dancer, and
led with a sureness and ease quite masculine. After
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>a couple of turns about the room Leslie had been
obliged to discard her umbrella. She had boldly
set it up inside the orchestra’s picket fence where
it would be less likely to attract the attention of
prankish wags.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the beginning of the fifth dance Leslie was not
yet ready to go. She glanced at the wall clock
which stood at five minutes to nine. It was still too
early for unmasking. She believed herself safe for
at least two more dances after the one about to begin.
She started toward a group of two or three
disengaged maids.</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly from the farther end of the gymnasium
a cry arose which Leslie mistook for “Unmask.”
It threw her into a panic. She forgot in her dismay
that Doris had said the signal for unmasking
would be the blast of a whistle. What she remembered
instead was her striped umbrella. She was
only a few steps from the orchestra corner. She
made a frantic rush to it, reached over the low
picket fence and snatched up the umbrella. She
turned away, not noticing that she had laid low a
section of the fence. She hurried across the floor,
bent only on reaching the door.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh!” A forceful exclamation went up as she
crashed against a couple who had begun to dance.
The force of the collision fairly took the breath of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>all three girls. Leslie made an unintentional backward
step. The umbrella slid from under her arm
toward the floor just as the jostled swain and his
lady were about to move on. It tripped the rustic
gallant neatly and he sprawled forward full length
on the highly waxed floor, dragging his partner
with him.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <br />A RANK OUTSIDER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“What a clumsy creature you are!” The fallen
gallant scrambled up from the floor and delivered
the opinion in a feminine voice. It was shrill and
wrathful. It rose in its shrillness above the rhythmic
melody of the orchestra. “It’s both inconsiderate
and dangerous in you to carry such a large
umbrella onto the floor. Your face and your behavior
go nicely together.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Beg your pardon for upsetting you, but keep
your opinion to yourself.” Leslie began the reply
with forced politeness, but ended her words almost
in a hiss. Behind her simpering mask she was a
dark fury. “I never allow anyone to speak in that
tone to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How do you propose to prevent my saying what
I please?” came back tauntingly from the belligerent
swain. His partner, a slender, graceful figure in a
pale yellow gingham gown placed a gently arresting
hand on her angry gallant’s arm. It was shaken
off with instant hateful impatience.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“I don’t propose to do that. Nothing short of a
clamp could keep you from shrieking.” Leslie had
changed in a twinkling to rude insolence. “I’ll
have mercy on my ear drums and beat it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wha-a-t?” The angry swain’s voice had suddenly
changed key. It had lowered in a mixture
of amazed, disapproving conviction.</p>

<p class='c005'>The utterance of that one amazed word acted upon
Leslie like a sudden dash of cold water. She wheeled
and swaggered on down the room with an air of
elaborate unconcern. It was entirely make-believe.
Her heart was thumping with dismay. She had
spoken after having vowed within herself that whatever
might happen at the romp she would remain
mute. More, she was afraid she had been recognized
by the student whom she had unwittingly
tripped up with her umbrella. Something in those
higher pitched tones had sounded familiar. She
could not then remember, however, of whom they
reminded her.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had turned away from the quarrel just in
time. Attracted by the commotion at that part of
the gymnasium more than one pair of dancers had
steered toward the accident center. Some of these
now headed Leslie off in her perturbed journey
down the room. They collected about her with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>mischievous intent, hemming her in and calling out
to her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Such a pretty boy!” “Hello, April smiles!”
“Wait a minute, puddeny-woodeny!” “I’m crazy
about you!” were some of the pleasantries hurled
at her. Under other circumstances Leslie would have
laughed at the extravagances. Now she was growing
worried for her own security from identification.
She was now in precisely the situation against
which Doris had warned her. Suppose the call to
unmask were to come just then? She resolved
desperately that, unheeding it, she would bolt for
the door.</p>

<p class='c005'>Meanwhile the tripped-up rustic was sputtering
to his dainty partner in a manner which indicated
trouble to come for Leslie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wouldn’t stand such insolence from another
student, much less from an intruder,” Julia Peyton
was saying wrathfully. “I wouldn’t—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Try to forget the matter, Miss Peyton,” urged
a soft voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shan’t. Who are you, and how do you happen
to know me?” demanded Julia rudely. “<i>You</i>
don’t know who that mask is. I <i>do</i>. She has no
invitation or right to be here tonight. It’s against
all Hamilton tradition. Doris Monroe is to blame
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>for this outrage. She has helped that horrid Miss
Ca—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am Miss Dean, Miss Peyton,” came the interruption,
low, but vibrating with sternness. “You
will please not mention the name you were going to
say.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll do as I please about that. I’ll do more. I’ll
expose that Miss Cairns before she has a chance to
leave here. I know who’s to blow the whistle for
unmasking. She is a sophie friend of mine. I’ll
ask her to blow it now. Then we’ll see what Miss
Cairns will do.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Before Marjorie could stop her she had started
up the room on a hunt for the sophomore who had
been detailed to blow the unmasking whistle. A
dismayed glance after Julia, then Marjorie followed
her. There was but one thing she could do. She
must follow Julia and discover to which sophomore
had been intrusted the signal detail. Each class
had been given a certain amount of the details for
the romp. Among sophomore details was the
sounding of the unmasking signal.</p>

<p class='c005'>Unaware that she was being followed by Marjorie,
Julia had gone on a tour of the room, searching
this way and that, with spiteful eagerness. She
now had a stronger motive for exposing Leslie than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>the latter’s offense against tradition. She was determined
to be even with Doris for having “almost”
snubbed her on numerous occasions. It would not
reflect to Doris’s credit to be named as the student
who had smuggled into the gym a girl who had been
expelled from Hamilton.</p>

<p class='c005'>The sophomore who was to blow the whistle was
Jane Everest. Dressed in a befrilled frock of apricot
dotted swiss, Jane formed a bright spot of color
among the pale blues and pinks which was easily
picked out. Julia had little trouble locating her.
Marjorie, now not more than three yards behind
Julia, reached the pair almost as soon as Julia hailed
Jane. The two had met before that evening. Each
knew the other’s costume.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who do you think is here tonight?” Julia caught
Jane’s arm. This time she took the precaution of
whispering to her. “Leslie Cairns,” she answered
before Jane could speak. “<i>Isn’t that outrageous.</i> I
want <i>you</i> to blow the whistle this instant. She’s
down there in the middle of a crowd. She won’t
be able to get free of it. She <i>must</i> be exposed Jane.
It’s necessary to the interest of the whole college
that she should be sternly dealt with. Imagine her
sneaking in here under the cover of a mask.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why—That <i>is</i> really dreadful, Julia,” Jane
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>whispered back. “Are you sure? Some of the
freshies don’t want the whistle blown until ten
o’clock. The committee says it had better be after
the next dance. I ought to do as they wish, you
know. Where is she?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Down there.” Julia nodded sulkily toward a
group of enjoying wags at the far end of the gymnasium.
Those who composed it were finding more
sport in teasing Leslie than in dancing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie was waiting until Julia should have
finished whispering to the apricot mask before soliciting
the latter’s attention. She was uneasily watching
the fun going on around Leslie. She could not
be sure that the mask to whom Julia was whispering
was the one to blow the unmasking whistle. For all
she knew Julia might have stopped to cite her grievance
to one of her particular friends.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is she that ridiculous, silly-faced mask?” Jane
cried. “<i>She’s</i> awfully droll.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I fail to see it.” Julia was haughtily contradictory.
“Will you please blow the whistle now,
Jane? You know she shouldn’t be here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Please pardon me, I must speak to you.” Marjorie
had made up her mind to act. If the apricot
mask were the soph detailed to blow the whistle,
then she must be asked to delay blowing it until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Leslie could be steered from the gym without discovery.
If she were not the one appointed Marjorie
decided that she would hurry down to Leslie and inform
her of the danger.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have no—” Julia began angrily.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am Miss Dean,” ignoring Julia, Marjorie
serenely continued. “Will you please tell me who
you are?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yours truly, Jane Everest, Marjorie.” A little
laugh rippled out from behind the concealing mask.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Jane!” There was inexpressible relief in
the exclamation. “I’m so glad it’s you. Are you
the soph who is to blow the unmasking whistle?
If you are, don’t blow it for at least ten minutes
yet.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I insist that Miss Everest shall blow it, and at
once,” burst forth Julia Peyton furiously. “She has
just promised <i>me</i> that she will.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, I haven’t promised to blow the whistle at
once, Julia,” Jane steadily corrected.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What right have <i>you</i> to interfere in our fun?
Post graduates are not supposed to interest themselves
too closely in class affairs.” Julia tossed her
head in withering disdain of Marjorie. “What right
have <i>you</i> to prevent <i>me</i> from exposing that detestable
Miss Cairns. Do you consider it honorable or fair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>to the traditions of Hamilton to permit a former
student who was expelled to come on the campus
socially?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How do you know, Miss Peyton, that Miss
Cairns, a former student of Hamilton, is present in
the gymnasium, or has been here this evening?”
Marjorie inquired with a cool evenness that made
Julia gasp. “Have you seen her?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I <i>know</i>, and so do you. Didn’t she trip us with
her umbrella? Didn’t we hear her voice. <i>I</i> recognized
it. <i>You</i> may not have.” The answer was
freighted with sarcasm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A masker carrying an umbrella tripped us. When
she spoke her voice sounded like that of Miss Cairns,”
Marjorie stated impersonally. “I did not see the
masker’s face. Did you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What difference does <i>that</i> make?” sharply countered Julia.
“We both recognized her by her voice.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Since we did not see her face how can we be sure
that we recognized her. Lacking the evidence of
our own eyes our best plan is to launch no accusations
against Miss Cairns. Jane,” Marjorie turned
to the sophomore, “when are you going to blow the
unmasking whistle?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“After the next dance. This dance is ending now,
I think.” Jane turned momentary attention to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>music, which was beating to a syncopated end. “That
is the time the floor committee has set. I can change
it if you like, Marjorie.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, thank you. That suits me nicely. I must
go now, but I’ll see you soon after unmasking,
Jane.” With a slight, courteous inclination of the
head to Miss Peyton, Marjorie walked composedly
down the great room to where Leslie stood, still
surrounded.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie had not spoken to Leslie Cairns more
than two or three times during the long period of
time in which they had been students together at
Hamilton. She had never spoken to Leslie since
Leslie had been away from the college. She now
wondered what she could say to the uninvited masker
which might not be too humiliating to her.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <br />A FRIENDLY TURN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Circling the group around Leslie she approached
the latter from the left side. Simultaneous with
her approach the opening strains of a fox trot broke
up the group. Not more than half a dozen persistent
“rushers” lingered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let’s move on,” she breathed to Leslie. She
adopted a soft almost babyish tone. As she spoke
she took light hold of Leslie’s arm and began to
steer her gently free of the few masks who were
mischievously trying to detain the foolish-faced
swain.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Surest thing you know, sweetums,” Leslie returned
in a deep gruff voice. “You’re the little kid
who fell over my amberil. I didn’t go for to trip
you up, peaches. Want to dance?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not yet. Let’s go walking up the hall so folks
can see your han’some face.” Obeying an impish
impulse Marjorie added, “It is simply celostrous.
It’s the only one you have, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“By cricky, it is. I ought to be proud of it.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Leslie was oddly pleased to have the partner of
“that screech owl” single her out for friendly attention.
“I knowed you wasn’t mad at me, kid,” she
next volunteered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, I wasn’t.” The small soft voice held positiveness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s fine. I <i>know</i> you’ve got a kind face.”
Both girls indulged in a smothered giggle at this
inane tribute.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fade away,” Leslie waved a careless hand toward
two or three lingering tormentors. “Can’t
you let me and my girl alone?” She brandished her
umbrella at them and swaggered out of their ken
with Marjorie on an arm.</p>

<p class='c005'>They looked after her, laughing, but did not
pursue the pair. Leslie thought it extremely lucky
that she should have been singled out for attention
by “friendly ruffles.” She had no idea where
in the big room to look for Doris. She dared not
linger to search for her. Her one thought now
was to gain the safety of outdoors before unmasking
time came.</p>

<p class='c005'>Up the room the pair now strolled with an air
of rustic gaiety. It was simulated by both with
difficulty. They kept fairly close to the west wall
of the gymnasium so as to be well out of the path
of the dancers. Neither appeared to be in a hurry.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Both were battling against a strong desire to break
into a run.</p>

<p class='c005'>They were nearing the door before a knowledge
of what to say to Leslie came to little “friendly
ruffles.” Marjorie came into a sudden understanding
that Leslie was as anxious as she to reach the
door. With unspoken intent both had steered
directly for it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lightly withdrawing her fingers from her escort’s
arm Marjorie said in a very low, distinct
tone. “The unmasking will take place after this
dance. There will be a short intermission then.
The girls will probably go parading about the
campus.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who are you? Do you know me?” Leslie had
instantly caught the hidden inference. Her partner
knew her to be an outsider.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Does it matter who we are? I must go. Good
night.” Followed the gracious addition. “Your
costume was much the funniest at the romp.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In the second of silence which succeeded the
compliment the two maskers faced each other, Leslie
across the threshold now, Marjorie still inside
the vestibule.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you, and double thank you,” Leslie said
in an odd muffled voice. “Good night.” She turned
and started across the campus at a swinging stride
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>which might have belonged to a true country boy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank goodness,” breathed Marjorie. She
watched the lonely figure fast disappearing into the
darkness and a feeling of pity rose in her heart because
Leslie could not remain at the romp and enjoy
the fun of winning the prize her ludicrous get-up
merited.</p>

<p class='c005'>It had taken longer than she thought to conduct
Leslie to the door. Marjorie decided it to be hardly
worth while to renew her search for Robin Page,
whom thus far she had not been able to pick out
among the rustic throng. She had not more than
re-entered the ball room when the unmasking
whistle blew shrilly. Its high, piercing blasts were
immediately drowned by waves of echoing laughter
as masks were removed and identities jubilantly
made known.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie made a swift rush forward to meet an
Irish country woman who was jogging peacefully
along, a small, covered, green and white basket
on her arm. She was dressed in a voluminous
bright-figured brown cretonne dress. Over her
shoulders was a green and red plaid shawl, on her
head a white mob cap with a full white outstanding
ruffle and a huge green satin bow decorating the
front of it. Wide flat black slippers, green and red
plaid hosiery which her ankle length dress permitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>a glimpse of and a bright green umbrella completed
her gay attire.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now for the sake av ould Ireland, is it yerself
I am finding forninst me?” demanded the delighted
Hibernian lady, offering Marjorie one end of her
umbrella to shake instead of her hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, it is certainly myself and no other. But
<i>where</i> have you been? Not out on the floor. I
never saw sign of you in that costume until this
minute. You tricky old Celt. You appeared late
on purpose, <i>that’s</i> what you did,” Marjorie accused.</p>

<p class='c005'>Leila smiled widely and cheerfully. “Now how
can you blame me? Since I am Irish then how
could I appear in the gym in an Irish costume of
my own special fancy and not have the campus
dwellers add two and two? So I have had a fine,
exciting time sitting up in my room twirling my
Irish thumbs until time for me to set out for the
festival.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What a mean thing to do; to put your friends
to so much needless trouble. How long have you
been on the floor?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Leila looked thoughtful then beamed again: “Perhaps
three minutes,” she admitted. “I have not yet
met a Traveler except you, Beauty. You are the
same beauty-bright colleen as ever. You would be
that though dressed in canvas bags.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>“You are direct from County Blarney,” Marjorie
made a gesture of unbelief. “Jerry and I
picked out Muriel first thing. She is so funny. I
knew Ronny and Lucy, too, and Lillian. I’m sorry
Kathie couldn’t be in this. That’s the penalty she
pays for being of the faculty. Let’s go Traveler
hunting, Leila.” She took Leila’s arm and the two
strolled on together further to investigate the many
groups of mirthful, chattering rustics who crowded
the spacious room.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was not long before Leila and Marjorie were
the center of a group of their own composed of
Muriel, Vera, Lillian, Lucy, Barbara Severn,
Ronny and Jerry. Leila circulated among them,
beaming affably. She announced mysteriously that
she had something nice to give each one.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s a gift basket which I stole from a leprechaun
and in it is a magic charm for each and all. Be
pleased to hold one hand behind your back when I
give out the charms. Shut your fingers tight down
on the charm so it can not vanish away. When I
give the word you may look at them. Now be
fair and do not peep at them until I give you the
word.”</p>

<p class='c005'>With this glib injunction Leila slid a hand into
the basket and drew it out tightly closed about
some small object. She ordered the company to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>stand in a circle, each with a hand behind her back.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it?” cried Muriel as her hand received
and tightly clutched the small smooth round object.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now you shall see how fond I am of you.”
Leila had hurriedly given out the rest of the charms.
“You may all look.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A chorus of derisive groans mingled with
laughter followed the gracious permission. Each
Traveler had been presented with a small potato.
Its new pale skin had been scrubbed to immaculate
cleanness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A charming charm, I must say,” giggled Muriel.
“Let’s forcibly lead the Celtic sorceress out on the
campus and peg at her with these praties. If she
isn’t hit by any of them we shall know that they
are either bewitched or else we can’t throw straight.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In the midst of the fun her friends were having
over Leila’s charms, remembrance of Leslie Cairns
and her constrained flight from the scene of fun returned
to Marjorie. She had sufficient cause to regard
Leslie as an enemy, yet she did not hold her as
such. Now she was feeling nothing but a kind regret
that Leslie had barred herself out of Hamilton and all
its pleasures. She decided that she would not tell even
Jerry of the incident. Common sense whispered to
her that Doris Monroe must have aided Leslie in
the escapade. They had probably met on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>campus and gone to the gymnasium together. Marjorie
knit her brows in an effort to recall a dancing
partner of Leslie’s. She herself had noticed and
repeatedly laughed at the foolish-faced farmer before
the collision with Leslie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What are you scowling about?” Jerry happened
to note Marjorie’s puckered brows. “Let me
sweeten your disposition by treating you to wintergreen
lozenges and crimson lemonade.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I accept your generous offer. I hope you have
money enough to treat lavishly,” Marjorie accepted
Jerry with this pertinent hint, after having been
affectionately jabbed in the side with Jerry’s elbow.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I got cash,” Jerry boasted, thrusting her free
hand into a pocket of her overalls. “I still got
some ’o my Fourthy July money. I didn’t spend
nothing that day hardly. It rained lickety whoop.
Silas Pratt near got swept off the speaker’s stand a
deliverin’ his Fourthy July ration. I heerd at the
last the stand floated right off in the woods a carryin’
the Hamtown choir, Revern’d Skiggs and three
boys as was sittn’ on the bottom steps of it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie and Jerry headed gaily for the lemonade
stand calling back buoyant invitations to their
friends to join them. As they drew near the stand
a girl turned away from it and glanced at them.
She was golden-haired and lovely in her white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>dimity frock scattered thickly with violets. Neither
Marjorie nor Jerry could do other than admire her
and her becoming costume. The trio did not exchange
salutations.</p>

<p class='c005'>Doris Monroe had not spoken to Jerry more than
once or twice since coming to Hamilton. She had
not even bowed to Marjorie since her own refusal
to go to Sanford with Muriel on a Christmas vacation.
Now she stared at Marjorie’s costume,
rather than at Marjorie herself, in dismayed fascination.
She had made a discovery which was
anything but pleasing to her.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <br />A DISHEARTENING SITUATION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The discovery that Marjorie was the rustic maid
in the pale yellow gingham gown who had accompanied
Leslie Cairns to the door of the gymnasium
was a distinct shock to Doris. Following the Rustic
Romp she received a second jolt when Julia Peyton
waylaid her on the campus to inform her triumphantly
that she had something “very important
to say about Miss Cairns.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whatever it may be, say it now,” Doris commanded,
keeping curiosity and interest well out of
her tone. During the progression of her sophomore
year she had grown to dislike Julia more and more.
In the beginning she had tolerated resignedly Julia’s
jealous preference for her society. Now she did
not care whether either Julia or Clara Carter liked
her or not.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I couldn’t <i>think</i> of saying it now. I haven’t
time. It’s something confidential.” Julia crested her
black head importantly. Her black, moon-like eyes
fixed themselves upon Doris in a mysterious stare.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>“Now, or not at all.” Doris stood firm. “I’d
prefer not to invite you to my room because of Miss
Harding. I don’t like to go to yours. You and
Miss Carter nearly always quarrel. It’s such a
bore to listen to you.” She affected a weary expression.</p>

<p class='c005'>Julia cast a frowning glance about her. She
glanced hastily up at the clock tower and said doggedly:
“I must go. I’ll meet you at the big green
seat near the west side of the campus at five this
afternoon. I have your welfare at heart, even
though you don’t think so,” she flung this reproachfully
at Doris. “I simply <i>must</i> speak to you about
Miss Cairns.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Doris knew nothing of Julia’s unfortunate fall
over Leslie’s umbrella. She had gone outdoors after
a spirited dancing number, in company with half
a dozen merry masks, for a breath of the sweet
spring air. The spill had occurred while she was
outside. When she had returned she had been immediately
claimed for the next dance. A little later
while dancing she had caught sight of Leslie surrounded
by hilarious maskers. She had hurried to
extricate her from her difficulties as soon as the
dance was over. She had then spied Leslie moving
towards the vestibule door in company with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>mask in yellow gingham. It filled her with an immeasurable
relief to know that Leslie had, as she
supposed, escaped discovery and was then on her
way to leaving the frolic.</p>

<p class='c005'>To learn soon afterward that Marjorie Dean had
been Leslie’s companion to the door was not re-assuring.
Her heart sank at the very thought
until her first agitation had passed. She had recollected
that, masked, Miss Dean might not have
recognized Leslie. Leslie had promised not to talk.
She and Marjorie were as strangers to each other;
had been for some time. Doris could only marvel
at the queer twist of fortune which had brought
Leslie and Marjorie together. According to Leslie’s
accounts the two were bitter enemies. Masked,
they had paraded up the gymnasium together on apparently
congenial terms.</p>

<p class='c005'>This latest thought completely re-assured Doris.
Of course they had not recognized each other!
Knowingly, neither would have gone a step with
the other. Leslie had undoubtedly managed to free
herself from her partner before reaching the door.
Directly after the unmasking Doris had skipped a
dance purposely to make a careful search on the
floor for Leslie. Leslie had disappeared, completely
and satisfactorily.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Doris had not said to Julia Peyton whether or
not she would meet her at the big green campus
bench near the west entrance. She changed her
mind about going half a dozen times before five
o’clock came. She had expected to hear from Leslie
on the telephone through the day. No call from
Leslie came until a quarter to five that afternoon.
The message was a fairly polite invitation from Leslie
to drive to Orchard Inn to dinner. She agreed
to meet Doris on Hamilton Pike in front of the
central campus gates.</p>

<p class='c005'>Since she had come downstairs to answer the telephone
Doris decided to walk over to the campus
bench and learn what Julia had to say about Leslie.
She was to meet Leslie at half past five. She would
not spend more than ten or fifteen minutes in Julia’s
company. Since the romp was over, and nothing
of mishap had occurred to Leslie on the frolicsome
occasion, Doris was not inclined to borrow trouble
over whatever Julia might have to say of Leslie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m glad you came.” Julia rolled her black eyes
at Doris in an expression of spiteful satisfaction.
“You must have <i>some</i> idea of what I have to say,
after what happened last night.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I didn’t intend to come. I happened to be
downstairs, so I changed my mind about meeting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>you. I do not know what you mean by saying ‘after
what happened last night.’ How can I possibly know
what you are going to say?” Doris asked the question
with a suspicion of sarcasm in her tone.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Are you pretending you don’t know what happened?”
Julia asked offendedly. “Weren’t you on
the floor most of the time before the unmasking?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, but I saw nothing happen, either remarkable
or dreadful. You told me this morning you
had something to say to me about Miss Cairns.
Whatever happened last night has nothing to do
with her,” Doris said coldly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t understand you at all, Doris,” Julia cried
resentfully. “Didn’t you know that Miss Cairns
tripped Miss Dean and me last night while we were
dancing, and that we both fell?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Doris shook her head in blank amazement. “I
did not know,” she said very positively. “When
did that happen? I went outdoors for a few minutes
about two numbers before unmasking time. Was
it then, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Maybe it was. You admit then that Miss Cairns
was in the gym,” was the triumphant return.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I admit nothing.” Doris managed to keep up
her cold composure. Anger gleamed in her green
eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“She was there, even if you won’t admit it. She
behaved like a boor to me. She crashed into us
like a locomotive and poked a miserable umbrella
she carried squarely between our feet. How could
we help but fall? I simply said I thought it wasn’t
best for her to carry such a large umbrella on the
dancing floor. You should have heard the insulting
things she said to me, and to Miss Dean. She was
in a terrible rage. I had all I could do to keep my
temper.” Julia endeavored to look very superior.</p>

<p class='c005'>Doris did not make the mistake of uttering a word.
She purposed to hear Julia out before speaking. The
sophomore was more than satisfied to be allowed
to do all the talking.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I knew it was Miss Cairns by her voice. I was
<i>so</i> shocked. After she had abused us both she swaggered
off down the room. Then my partner told
me that she was Miss Dean. I was <i>so</i> surprised.
She said we had best not tell anyone just then that
Miss Cairns was on the floor—the best way to do
was not to mention names, but to order her out
of the gym quietly. She did that very thing herself.
Just before the unmasking I saw Miss Dean
walking Miss Cairns up the gym and to the vestibule
door. In two or three minutes Miss Dean came
back alone.” Julia gave out this information with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>malicious relish. “But that’s not <i>all</i> Miss Dean
did. She played a trick on the whole college which
I think very ignoble.” She paused to note the
effect on Doris of this remarkable news.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go on,” Doris commanded with bored amusement.
“Your tale of the Rustic Mask is growing
interesting.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You may find it more so.” A dull angry red
overspread Julia’s pasty-white complexion. “I
haven’t come to your part in it yet.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No?” Doris smilingly tilted her golden head and
raised polite brows.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Dean acted entirely against the traditions
of Hamilton,” she continued sullenly. “She went
straight to Jane Everest, who was detailed to blow
the whistle for unmasking and asked her not to blow
it until she, Miss Dean, gave her the signal. She
told Jane why, too. She had asked <i>me</i> not to say
a word to a soul about Miss Cairns.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How do you happen to know all this?” Doris
asked in a quick sharp tone.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was with Miss Dean. I—er—I didn’t—I
couldn’t get away from her just then. So I heard
the whole thing.” Julia floundered briefly, but ended
in triumph.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What did Miss Everest say?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“She said she would wait to blow it. I was so
disgusted with them both for their disloyalty to tradition
I simply turned and left them. You know,
Doris, that Miss Dean had no business to ask Jane
Everest to disobey the order of the senior dance committee.
They had set the time for unmasking. It
was very dishonorable for her to try to shield an expelled
student who had taken advantage of the masquerade
to trick her way into the gym. Miss Cairns
couldn’t possibly ever again have hoped to take part
in a college frolic after the way she left Hamilton.
She was considered utterly lawless by the Board,
Prexy and the faculty. I’ve heard <i>volumes</i> against
her since I came to Hamilton.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Dean knows more against Miss Cairns, so
I’ve been told, than any other student at Hamilton.
She and Miss Cairns were rivals for popularity while
Miss Cairns was on the campus. They used to play
all sorts of dishonorable tricks upon each other, I
suspect,” Julia eyed Doris darkly, “that Miss Dean
didn’t have the—the—courage to expose Miss
Cairns. It would take a person of very high principle
to expose Miss Cairns openly on the floor of the
gym, as she should have been exposed. I hope, for
<i>your</i> sake, Miss Dean won’t tell her pals about it.
If she does, it will soon be campus gossip.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“Why for my sake?” Doris still refused to be
included in Julia’s implications.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s sweet in you to try to protect Miss Cairns,
Doris, I honor you for it.” Julia said, her reply
reeking acidity. “But you can’t deceive me. I know
the farmer with the striped umbrella was Miss
Cairns. I saw you go through the grand march
and dance the first dance with her. I knew you by
your walk and I came up close to you on purpose
and took a good look at you to make sure. I know
your emerald ring and I saw some of your hair
fluffing out from under your hat.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I went through the grand march and danced the
first number with a rustic swain,” Doris stated with
deliberate coldness. “I did not see my partner’s
face. Did you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s not the point,” Julia evaded, stung to
exasperation by her classmate’s cool reception of her
revelation. “What I came here <i>specially</i> to tell you
is that you had better not be seen going around with
Miss Cairns. This story will travel, I feel sure.
You’ll be severely criticized and dropped by most
of the students. Even your good looks won’t save
you. It was very inconsiderate and selfish of Miss
Cairns to put you in such a risky position. She
is certainly not your friend. The crowd last night
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>was frisky. If the girls had had the least idea
of whom she was they would have ripped off her
mask, hooted her from the gym and maybe the
campus. How would you have felt then?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I only know the way I feel now. I don’t like
you, Miss Peyton, and I never have.” Doris chose
to be drastically candid. “If a story such as you have
just told me should go the round of the campus, I
should not blame Miss Dean or Miss Everest for
having started it. I should blame you. I intend
to be silent. Let me give you a piece of advice.
You had best be silent, too, about what you <i>believe</i>
you know against Miss Cairns.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <br />THE TRUTH ABOUT “BEAN”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Doris had only time enough to hurry back to the
Hall for her wraps before starting out again to
meet Leslie. She did not regret her blunt words
to Julia. The gossiping, jealous sophomore had deserved
them. Doris had grown tired of Julia’s impudent
interference into her personal affairs. This
time Julia had gone too far. Doris had decided to
drop her, oblivious of what the sophomore might
afterward say of her. She believed sturdily that she
could defend her own position at Hamilton.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You certainly deserted me,” was Leslie’s greeting
as Doris stepped into the roadster, parked at the
central gates. “Last night, I mean,” she added
with her slow smile.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I never meant to,” Doris apologized. “You said
you preferred to look out for yourself. I saw you
in the middle of that crowd of freshies and was worried
about you. By the time I could get free of my
partner to go to you I saw you on the way out of
the gym.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>“Thanks to little yellow gingham ruffles, Leslie
Adoree broke away from the merry rustic scene with
colors flying and her false face still on. I had a
good time, though, while it lasted.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did that unwieldy umbrella really trip a couple
who were dancing?” Doris inquired abruptly. She
was anxious to learn whether Julia had told her the
truth in the matter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It really did.” Leslie’s face suddenly lost its
half humorous expression. “One of them was a
screech owl posing as a rustic youth. Her voice had
a familiar sound. Still there are so many varieties
of screech owl on the campus,” she ended sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The ‘screech owl’ was Miss Peyton. The other
girl was—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Peyton. No wonder I felt like pitching
in and fighting her while I had my farm togs on.”
Leslie’s tone indicated her disgust. “She was outrageous,
Goldie. I tried to stay dumb, but I
couldn’t. I finally said two or three pithy things
to her. Little yellow gingham ruffles was all right.
She tried to keep us from fussing. Afterward she
came down to where I was and walked me away
from a gang who had been trying to rag me. She
walked me up the gym to the vestibule door and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>joked with me all the way. She had on a pale yellow
gingham dress with little yellow ruffles and a
white hat with—</p>

<p class='c005'>“What did she say to you, Leslie?” was Doris’s
anxious interruption. “I mean when you reached
the door.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That was the queer part. She knew me. I’m
almost sure of it. She didn’t say a word about my
going, but she knew I wanted to get out of the gym
before unmasking. She went to the door with me
to keep off trouble. She was a good sport; an upper
class girl probably. Some one I may have met. I
know a few juniors and seniors who were freshies
and sophs when I was a senior.” Leslie gave an
inaudible sigh. Last night’s frolic had brought back
vividly the memory of her failure as a student.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The girl in the yellow gingham ruffled dress was
Miss Dean,” Doris said in a peculiar tone.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What?” In her surprise Leslie allowed the roadster
to run off the course on the pike she was keeping
by several inches. She instantly brought the machine
back to course. Apparently struck dumb, she leaned
forward, staring interestedly at the road ahead. Just
then she could think of nothing to say. Presently
she found speech again.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, it was Bean,” she said dully. “I know it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>now. Why didn’t you come and walk me away
from her when you saw us together?” Leslie demanded,
her accent displeased.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I didn’t know then that the mask you were with
was Miss Dean. I didn’t know it until I saw her
after the unmasking.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She did me a good turn.” Leslie stopped, her
face reddening. It was the first time she had ever
said a good word for Marjorie to any one. “How
soon after I got away from the gym did the whistle
blow?” she inquired soberly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not more than two or three minutes. You got
away just in time. I didn’t know about Miss Peyton
and Miss Dean and the umbrella business until
this afternoon. Miss Peyton told me. I must have
been outside the gym when it happened. I was out
on the campus with a crowd for a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Doris had wisely decided not to tell Leslie of what
Julia Peyton had said. Julia was fond of telling her
friends and classmates anything disagreeable which
she might have heard of them. Doris abhorred the
pernicious habit. Instead she began to quiz her
companion about the umbrella mishap. She had a
curiosity to know Julia Peyton’s exact part in it.
She had not wholly credited the sophomore’s side
of the story.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Leslie answered, at first rather abstractedly. Her
mind was still centered on the “good turn” which
“Bean” had done her. Presently she dropped into
a humorous account of the accident which made
Doris laugh. Julia had declared Leslie to be lawless
and dishonorable. Doris wondered if it were
really true of her. Leslie had treated her fairly.
She began to believe she liked Leslie despite the latter’s
occasional spells of domineering insolence. She
made up her mind then and there to learn if she
could the history of Leslie’s and Marjorie Dean’s
enmity from its beginning.</p>

<p class='c005'>Leslie’s account of the umbrella incident, humorous
and truthful, differed considerably from that of Julia
Peyton. Doris wondered if Julia had not also misrepresented
matters to her about Muriel at Christmas
time. Then she remembered regretfully that
Muriel had admitted having said the very things
which had offended her pride. In the present instance
she chose to believe Leslie rather than Julia.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Harding won the prize for having the funniest
costume,” Doris ended a little silent interval
between the two girls. “She had on that ridiculous
imitation of a riding costume. You remember we
were laughing at her? The prize was a large jar
of stick candy. Your costume was really funnier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>than hers. Your mask was so screamingly silly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bean said I had the funniest costume,” Leslie
commented shortly. Her dark face grew darker as
she sent the roadster speeding over the smooth
pike. So it had been the girl she most disliked who
had conducted her merrily and surely out of an
embarrassing situation for which only herself was
to blame. Her mind began suggesting petty spiteful
reasons for Marjorie’s kindly act. She dismissed
them in the instant of their birth. None
of them were honest.</p>

<p class='c005'>Only one conclusion remained to be drawn in the
matter. Leslie faced it unwillingly. To give it
credence meant the crashing down of all the carefully
built-up cases against “Bean” which she had
cherished for over four years. In spite of the wilful
and malicious attempts she had made against
Marjorie’s welfare and peace of mind, “Bean,” it
now appeared, had no grudge against her.</p>

Captain’s coming here for Easter. Oh, joy! Tra,

frisky delight. A letter from her captain had
furnished impetus for the dance.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are a loyal Jeremiah as I’ve told you in

Marjorie stopped her frisky prance to pat Jerry on

of the Macy family? They may strongly object
to an Easter without Jeremiah.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They’ll have to bear it. It’ll be the first long

home at Easter. Leila, Vera, Robin, Ronny and
Lucy say they can’t spare the time away from the
campus. It would have broken up my work on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>the biography a little, and I’d have hated to leave
Miss Susanna. Still I would have gone. Captain
first, you know.” Marjorie lovingly patted her
mother’s letter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’d have gone home with you and risked being
called a shirker by the gang. I’d have borne it.
I’m as noble as you are, noble Bean. Here is a
copy of my latest jingle.” Jerry tendered Marjorie
a sheet of paper. “I caught it while you were busy
praising me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thoughtful bard,” Marjorie commended, flourishingly
accepting the paper. “May I inquire what
you intend to do today?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m going over to the campus right after breakfast.
Leila and I are going to make Norse helmets
for Norse warriors of buckram and silver paper.
With the help of our fertile brains and a little invincible
glue we shall win. What are you going to
do to while the day away?” Jerry inquired innocently.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, nothing special,” Marjorie waved an airy
hand. “That’s the way it seems sometimes,” she
added, her face sobering, “when I write all day and
then find at evening that I haven’t done more than
a page of good work. I’ve divided the material for
the biography into two parts. I wish to call the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>first part ‘Inspiration.’ The second part will be
‘Realization.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It sounds good to me.” Jerry waited breathlessly
to hear more. It was the first time Marjorie had
volunteered her any information on the subject of
her own writing. Jerry watched her as she might
have a rare song bird, which had poised itself near
her and was ready to take flight at the tiniest movement
on her part.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Inspiration’ is to be the story of his youth,
hopes and dreams. ‘Realization’ is to be the story
of the man, Brooke Hamilton, and his achievement.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Does Miss Susanna know what you’ve just told
me? You have such clam-like tendencies, Bean.”
Jerry smirked at her chum.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, I told her about it several days ago. I
only thought of it one day last week. I like the
idea.” Marjorie’s accompanying smile was utterly
without vanity. “If I could write as well as Kathie,
or Leila, or you, Jeremiah, I’d be happy. Really,
I have to dig out almost every sentence I write.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hooh!” derided Jerry. “I can’t write. You’re
simply trying to be polite to present company. So
deceitful!” She raised a hand in shocked reproach.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I never allow anyone to call me deceitful.” Marjorie
charged upon Jerry, who nimbly eluded her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>and ran for the door. She whisked out into the
hall and down the broad staircase with her vengeful
pursuer close behind her.</p>

<p class='c005'>The pair breezed around the corner of the newel
post just in time to crash into Jonas, who was
coming through the hall with a large feather duster
which one of the maids had accidentally left on the
hall rack.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mercy on us!” Jonas raised a startled arm.
He poked the duster full into Jerry’s face, to Marjorie’s
noisy delight.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ker-choo! I’m not the hall rack, Jonas, and
I don’t think I resemble the newel post, either,”
Jerry reproved.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, you don’t quite look like either of ’em,”
Jonas agreed, chuckling. “Excuse me for dusting
you,” taking a leaf from Jerry’s own book of etiquette
he slyly added, “and blame yourself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fine, Jonas, you’re learning,” Jerry heartily encouraged.</p>

<p class='c005'>The frolicsome pair lingered in the hall for a little
exchanging of merry repartee with Jonas. He now
looked forward to such lively encounters as a part
of his day’s program.</p>

<p class='c005'>At breakfast that morning Mrs. Dean’s letter
formed the main topic of conversation. Marjorie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>was bubbling over with happiness at the highly
agreeable way in which her affairs had worked out.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m the person fortune has singled out for attention,”
Miss Susanna crisply asserted. “All I need
do is stay quietly at home and watch my friends gravitate
to the Arms. Last Easter you girls all went
away from Hamilton and left poor Susanna without
a single playmate. This year Susanna has them
all, and with one more to come from another land.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s wonderful to know that Captain will soon
be here.” Marjorie’s voice was full of tender expectation.
“Her presence will furnish me with
oceans of fresh literary impetus. I shall need it
for ‘Realization,’ the second part of the biography.
It will be a good deal longer than the first part.
I wish they might have been of equal length.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The inspiration to build Hamilton College was
his life. At least he made it that,” Miss Susanna
said rather absently. She appeared to be immersed
in thought far remote from her spoken words.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s precisely why the first part of the biography
will be so much shorter than the second,”
Marjorie cried, her forehead puckering in faint
disapproval. “His very interesting years in China,
the building of Hamilton, all his work belongs in
‘Realization.’ He had begun to work, then, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>see, entirely toward realizing his splendid plans.
I’d love to have more data about his youth. There
is a great deal of the China data which would have
been lost if you hadn’t written down the stories he
told you of his life in the Orient,” she nodded gratefully
to Miss Susanna.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There may be some earlier data that I can let
you have for that first part,” was Miss Hamilton’s
vague promise. “I’ll see what I can find for you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie presently went to the study wondering
not a little as to what the data might be which
Miss Hamilton had promised. She surmised from
the old lady’s preoccupied air during the remainder
of the meal that Miss Susanna was mentally trying
to decide whether or not to give her for the biography
certain incidents in the life of Brooke Hamilton
which she had thus far withheld.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish you could really speak and tell me something
about yourself,” she said fancifully to Brooke
Hamilton’s portrait. “What were your favorite
sports when you were a very young man? Riding,
of course, and probably swimming. Did you—let
me think”—she stared reflectively at the portrait—“did
you ever win a hundred yard dash, or—a
yacht race?” She colored self-consciously at her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>own question. Her thoughts had veered suddenly
from Brooke Hamilton to Hal Macy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thought of Hal next reminded her that she would
not see Hal at Easter. That would be best for them
both. Still she visualized Hal’s disappointment, not
only at not seeing her—he would miss Jerry’s comradely
companionship. It would be of no use to
tell Jerry she ought to go to Sanford for Easter on
Hal’s account. Jerry would hoot at the idea. Marjorie
decided that she would write Hal a particularly
cordial Easter letter to try to make up for her absence.</p>

<p class='c005'>She brought her mind summarily back to the subject
of Brooke Hamilton. What was it Miss
Susanna had once said of him concerning love? And
when was it she had said it? An instant, and
Marjorie recalled the occasion. It was the only time
the mistress of the Arms had ever mentioned
Brooke Hamilton as having loved. She had said
on the occasion of Marjorie’s introduction to the portrait
of her kinsman in the study that Brooke Hamilton
had believed in the romance of deeds; not the
romance of love. She had also said that he had
“found after all that love was love. That the romance
of men and women—”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Susanna had stopped at this juncture and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>had never again renewed the subject. Marjorie grew
inwardly vexed with herself for having permitted
her thoughts to run toward love. Because, unfortunately,
Hal had fallen in love with her, the thought
of Hal must ever bring reminder of the unwelcome
fact. She was glad that Brooke Hamilton’s history
was one of deeds. In the mass of data she had
handled there had been personal mention made of
only his mother, Faith Gretney Hamilton, and Miss
Susanna.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve been mooning,” she informed the handsome,
blue-eyed man in the gilt frame. “Now I am going
to work hard. I must leave you in July for two
whole months. I wish you would come down from
the wall and finish writing your own story before
I come back. Wouldn’t that be a lovely magic surprise
for Marjorie?”</p>

<p class='c005'>A light tap on the study door sent her scurrying
to open it. Miss Susanna walked into the study an
odd look on her small shrewd features. In her
hands she carried a rosewood box. It was perhaps
eight by ten inches and not more than three inches
deep. It was a lock box with a beautifully executed
leaf border and a simple, artistically carved monogram
on the shining surface of the lid.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Marjorie, I have brought you Uncle Brooke’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>journal,” Miss Susanna began without preamble.
“I hadn’t intended to let you or anyone else ever
see it, much less permit a line of it to be published.
Since you have been at the Arms I have wondered
several times whether I was doing right in keeping
it from you. How can you acquire a true conception
of him unless you know him as his journal reveals
him?”</p>

<p class='c005'>As she talked Miss Susanna busied herself
with the turning of a tiny key in the lock. She
set the box on the study table, opened it. Inside it
lay an oblong notebook bound in black leather. It
was not very thick. Around it was a wide black
rubber band.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here it is.” The old lady lifted it from the
box with a sadly reverent air; handed it to Marjorie.
She accepted it, saying nothing. “It is a love story
you are going to read in this old black book, Marvelous
Manager; the love story of your friend,
Brooke Hamilton. He was a marvelous manager,
too, child. There was only one thing he did not
know how to manage. That was his heart.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <br />BROOKE HAMILTON’S ANGELA</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Marjorie looked from Miss Susanna to the portrait
and back again. The mistress of the Arms
was eyeing the portrait, too, with an expression of
dark melancholy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There’s no use in my staying here to talk with
you about this journal, child. I’ve read it several
times and almost cried my eyes out over it. In fact,
I don’t want to talk about it at all. I’m going.
After you have read it, I’ll have something else
to say. Not until then.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you, Miss Susanna,” Marjorie had only
time to call after the sturdy little woman as the
latter hurried from the room, furtively wiping her
eyes with her hem-stitched handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c005'>The young girl, who stood on the threshold of
life and love, even as Brooke Hamilton had once
stood, was equally the stranger to love that he had
been. Marjorie regarded the black leather book
with a glance of timid fascination. Between the
loose black covers, broken apart from much handling,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>in that small space, was the record of a love
which had not been a happy one. Over a happy
love idyl Miss Susanna would never have “almost
cried her eyes out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She understood that her remark at the breakfast
table concerning her lack of material for ‘Inspiration’
had set the question of the giving of the journal
to her going again in Miss Susanna’s mind.
Marjorie felt as though she stood on the brink of
the unknown. The love story of Brooke Hamilton
could not but be different from that of any of which
she had read or heard.</p>

<p class='c005'>She swept aside the pad of paper on which she
had been writing and carefully laid the journal on
the table before her. Slowly she removed the wide
rubber band and opened the book to the first page.
There in his clear handwriting stood a foreword:</p>

<p class='c005'>“May 1,” it began. “This is my birthday,
though not even the servants know it. Well, I have
purchased myself a gift; this black book. It shall
not be a black book in an evil sense. It shall only
record my doings which I shall hope to make ever
of purpose and right. Should I live to be a very
old man this journal will preserve for me facts
which memory will have long grown weary of holding.
I shall call this book a present from my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>mother. I do not approve of making presents to
myself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie smiled at the final sentence of the foreword.
It sounded so like Miss Susanna. The little
preamble was distinctly boyish, she thought. It had
the dignity, however, belonging to one brought up
in loneliness.</p>

<p class='c005'>She turned the page. The next item was brief
and dated three years later, but again May 1, it
stated:</p>

<p class='c005'>“My birthday again. I found this book today
in my desk. I had forgotten its use until I opened
it. I shall try once more to keep a record of personal
events. Three years between the two entries.
How time passes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>To her surprise the next entry was dated July
tenth, eight years later. It was humorously rueful.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I appear to be most unsuccessful as a journalist.
I have the will to record my doings but not
the execution. Tonight I am in an oddly pleasant
state of mind over the day’s events. The Vernons,
of Vernon Lodge, gave an archery meet this afternoon.
They held the meet in honor of a cousin,
Miss Angela Vernon, who has come to make her
home with them. Miss Vernon is an orphan with
a pleasing girlish face and soft chestnut curls. Her
voice is low and sweet and she has a merry fashion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>of showing her small white teeth in laughing which
is captivating. I enjoyed her company, which I
cannot state to be the truth of the majority of
young women whom I have met. I have no fault
to find with these except that they seem to be possessed
of so little depth. What a pretty name
Angela is. I like it far better than Rachel, Maria,
Abagail, Betsy or other feminine names similarly
plain and ugly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Vernons’ archery meet had staged the opening
incidents in Brooke Hamilton’s love affair. After
the entry of July tenth, followed others, in
somewhat scattered dating of the same year. Hardly
one of these but that made mention of Angela
Vernon. The young, attentive Brooke Hamilton
had been horseback riding with Angela. He had
escorted her to a lawn party. He had danced repeatedly
with her at the Hamilton country-side
ball. He wrote at some length in his journal of
the pleasure he derived from her company. Yet
into his writing never crept the word love.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie read on and on, forgetful of all but the
world the journal conjured for her in which the
author and Angela Vernon had once lived and
played their parts. Thus far she had experienced
no desire toward tears. Instead she was inclined
to signal annoyance at Brooke Hamilton for his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>attitude of complacency toward charming Angela
Vernon. At first she had been amused by his naive
admissions to his journal, so utterly devoid of
sentimentality. She had not then specially sympathized
with Angela. From his written comments
she could guess nothing of the young girl’s
mind toward him. An entry dated almost two
years later than the fateful archery meet brought an
odd aching sadness to Marjorie’s heart.</p>

<p class='c005'>“May 10. Life has moved very agreeably for
me in my ancestral home during the years of my
adolescence. Since my meeting with the Marquis
de Lafayette, however, all within me is changed.
There was a time to dance, to play, to be irresponsibly
youthful. That time has past. I am facing
the great problem of how one day to carry out
my dream of founding a democratic college for
young women in loving memory of my mother. In
order to do this I shall require great riches. These
I have not, though my father is not counted less
than rich. I have a plan by which I may attain
wealth in time. It must needs carry me far from
home. So be it. I am a free spirit. I am bound
by no pledge of love or duty.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am well satisfied that Angela and I are not
more than friends. Sometimes I wonder if we are
even such. She seems often cold, restrained in my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>presence where formerly she was invariably light
and cordially gay. I confess I do not always understand
young women. I shall soon be without her
comradely company. She is going to Philadelphia
to visit the Vernons there and dance at the Assembly
Ball. She is very charming. She says she will
never marry. Such a statement is not to be taken
seriously. I have frequently assured her that she
will no doubt wed a man high in the affairs of the
United States. She is fitted for diplomatic society.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Followed other entries of a similar nature. Marjorie
could not but marvel at the blindness of young
Brooke Hamilton to Angela Vernon’s love for him.
Unversed in the ways of young women the very
comments he wrote concerning her variable moods
toward him Marjorie translated as the attempts of
a girl in love to hide her unrequited affection from
its indifferent object of worship.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then came an entry made on shipboard on the
day when the founder of Hamilton had embarked
from New York on his first voyage to China. Her
eyes misted with sudden tears as she read:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Out at sea, the world before me! When I wonder
shall I see the Arms again? Not, I am resolved
until the battle’s won, my fortune made, my
dream become a reality. I have brought with me
my black book, a link between me and my younger,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>lighter hours of life. ‘When I became a man, I
put away childish things.’ So it is with me now.
I must strive and accomplish in the world of deeds.
Its only creed is action, and still more action. I
shall keep my book now as the path back to youth’s
pleasant orchard.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Angela gave me a utility case of dark blue silk
which she herself made. She also gave me a small
daguerrotype of herself. I was greatly touched by
her remembrance of me. She rode down to the
little station on her pony to wish me ‘<i>bon voyage</i>.’
It was hardly more than dawn. Hers was the last
face I saw among the home friends. She had been
crying. She said so quite frankly. I had no idea
she cared for me so fondly. She has flouted me
roundly at times. God knows when we shall meet
again. It appears strange that my friendliest comrade
should have been a young woman rather than
a young man. Angela has been such to me. I said
to her in jest: ‘You will have perhaps married and
forgotten me, Angela, by the time I return to my
country and the Arms.’ She said: ‘I shall never
forget you, and I shall never marry.’ So she thinks,
but time creates many changes. I am weary of
the pitching of the ship. I have not yet felt any
indication of seasickness. I shall close you, black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>book, and seek my rest. You must be my comrade
hereafter.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The part of the journal immediately following
Brooke Hamilton’s embarkation to the Orient continued
with brief notes on the voyage. From that
point on the entries dealt with the young fortune-seeker’s
life in China. These entries in themselves
Marjorie found valuable as aids in completing the
somewhat sparse data she already had regarding
the young man’s Oriental enterprise. Among them
she found odd bits of Chinese wisdom which he
quoted as the sayings of the several Chinese philosophers
who had become his intimate friends. These
original twists of mind, together with the numerous
stories of her kinsman’s life in China which Miss
Susanna had dictated to her would beautifully round
out the earlier chapters of “Realization.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie was presently surprised to find that the
China entries covered a period of over ten years.
Brooke Hamilton had evidently proved himself as
irregular a journalist abroad as at home. While the
entries were fuller than the earlier vaguer comments
of youth, a year in time was often covered
by three or four entries.</p>

<p class='c005'>She read steadily through the record of commercial
achievement which had brought him not
only immense wealth but honor and distinction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>among a philosophical, far-seeing race rarely understood
by Europeans or Americans. The Chinese
had liked him for his truth and honesty. Because
they had liked him they had helped him to his
goal of attainment.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was very little of Angela in this part of the
record. Now and again her name would appear
in, “I received a letter last week from Angela. It
has been many weeks on the way to me, judging
from the date of writing,” or, “Angela writes that
she believes I may never go back to America. How
little a girl understands a man’s high aspirations.
My absence from home is merely a necessary part
of my great plan. I shall try to make Angela understand.
Hers is a fine mind. She should not lend
it to such trivial conjectures. My return to America,
God sparing my life, is certain.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie’s sympathies were now firmly enlisted
toward Angela. She marveled that a man possessed
of Brooke Hamilton’s fine spirit and high
ideals should have so blindly passed by an unswerving
devotion like Angela’s. He had not loved her,
and had been honestly unaware that she loved him.
He had been too completely centered in the giant
labor he had set himself to perform to stop by the
way for flower gathering.</p>

<p class='c005'>The last entry of the China group inspired Marjorie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>with somber consternation. It had been
penned only a few months before the successful
man of affairs had returned to America and Hamilton
Arms.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I nearly lost Angela, my little comrade.” Followed
a blank; as though the writer had paused in
horror of his own words. “She has been near
death of pneumonia. I am shocked beyond expression.
I cannot image home without her to welcome
me. Since receiving the bad news in a letter
from her cousin, Adele Vernon, I have thought of
Angela night and day. I shall leave my business
interests here in Woo Fah’s hands and sail on the
next mail steamer. It is three months since Adele’s
letter was written. God knows what may have
happened to my little girl.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie cast a sorrowful upward glance at the
portrait. She thought she knew the tragic end
of the blue-eyed man’s love idyl. Nothing but
the rustle of the notebook’s leaf as she turned it
broke the hush pervading the study. Her eyes met
that which wrung from her a little cry of gladness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have found love. I know its meaning now.
I have come from the other side of the world to learn
the wonder of all wonders. It is not the wonder of
deeds. It is the wonder of a woman’s love, changeless
in its white glory. I walked in darkness, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>knowing. Now I have come into the light.
She always loved me, from the first day. How
could I have been so blind? There was a woman,
my mother, who loved me. There is a woman,
Angela, who loves me now. I know only these two.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We shall be married at Easter. That time seems
far off. Angela tells me it is only five months
away. From November until April I shall endeavor
to lavish upon her the devotion she says
she feared might never be hers. I chose achievement
instead of love. Yet love did not forsake
me. I have been magnificently favored by God.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The lovely, changeful face of the absorbed reader
lightened a little over the cheerful turn in the story.
Her faint smile died with the stark remembrance
that Brooke Hamilton had not married. She continued
reading with a sigh:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Christmas Eve, eleven o’clock. I have just returned
from Vernon Lodge. Early this evening I
heard my favorite carol, ‘God Rest You Merry
Gentlemen’ coming sweetly from the sitting room
bow window. Angela, Adele and Bobby Vernon
were the carolers. Angela’s high, entrancing soprano
voice still lingers in my ears. I think I shall
never wish to hear a truer, sweeter voice singing
the carol my mother so greatly loved.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course I caught them, brought them into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>the house, kissed Angela’s lips, under the mistletoe,
kissed Adele’s hand and shook hands with Bobby.
I would have entertained them at the Arms but
they marched me off to Vernon Lodge. There we
had one more divinely happy evening together.
Angela is always so full of life, so brimming over
with charm. I tell her sometimes she is too charming
for her strength. She is rather frail still from
the ravages of pneumonia. When we are married
we shall go overseas on a long honeymoon voyage.
This I believe will restore her to her former strength
of constitution.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie hastily turned the leaf. She was prepared
for disaster, but it came with a relentlessness
which made her heart ache:</p>

<p class='c005'>“May first. My birthday. I am alone. It is
two months since Angela died. Is that a long,
or a short space of time? I do not know. I know
only she is gone. She complained of being weary
in the evening. Next morning they found her
asleep, her dear little crinkling smile on her lips.
Pneumonia had weakened her heart. Even she did
not know to what extent. This afternoon I gathered
quantities of the double, fragrant purple violets for
which the Arms has been famed since my grandmother’s
day. I took them all to the Vernon vault,
my offering to love. Angela was not there, naturally.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Her radiant spirit had long since transcended
earth.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I, Brooke Hamilton, a strong man, remain here.
If only I had earlier understood love. I might
have, had I not been so closely wrapped in my
own dreams of achievement. What even greater
things I might have accomplished with her by my
side. Great love is the impetus to noble achievement.
I know it now. Dear Angela! I bruised
her tender heart with my selfish indifference to her
love for me. God in mercy willed that I should
not break it. Out of long years, four months!
Forgive me, sweet. I shall never write in this book
again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie put her curly head down on the table
and cried. She had lived and suffered that balmy
spring morning with Brooke Hamilton. She had
a sad impression that she had forever passed out
of the comfortable state of disinterest with which
she had formerly looked upon love. Nothing would
ever be the same again.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <br />ON THE ROAD TO ORCHARD INN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Mechanically, Marjorie closed the journal of
Brooke Hamilton and slipped the rubber around it.
She felt as though she never wished to open it again.
What a tragedy lay between those black, worn,
leather covers. Brooke Hamilton had suffered too
greatly she thought for that which he was not really
to blame.</p>

<p class='c005'>He had not understood that Angela loved him.
Still, he had upbraided himself with the remorseful
thought that he might have understood, if he had
tried. Angela had always loved him. She had
known that she loved him. He had not in the beginning
loved her, or at least he had given no
thought to love. The last despairing entry in the
journal held strong accusation against himself for
not having given love a place in his life. Mind had
dominated heart, when instead heart and mind should
have gone seeking love and achievement together.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the thought which had been pounding at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>the walls of her brain for admittance entered her
consciousness. Suppose that, some day, too late,
she were to discover she really loved Hal? She had
the same friendly regard for Hal which Brooke
Hamilton had entertained for Angela. Hal loved
her truly. Angela had truly loved Brooke Hamilton.</p>

<p class='c005'>The mere idea of such a far-fetched catastrophe
filled the sober-faced, lately tearful lieutenant with
panic. She took the sad little history of a man’s
ambition and misunderstanding and hurriedly replaced
it in the rosewood box. She turned the key,
then placed the box in the cabinet. Having now
read it, she could not bear to talk with Miss Susanna
again about it that day. She longed to go out in
the bright spring weather and walk until she had
shaken off the deep-seated melancholy which had
invaded her young heart. The quotation from Thanatopsis:
“Go forth, under the open sky, and list
to nature’s teachings,” recurred to her with force.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s almost time for luncheon,” she murmured.
“I can’t help it. I must go outdoors for awhile.
I shan’t write a line today. Maybe not tomorrow.
I’ll scribble a note to Miss Susanna and give it to
Jonas to hand to her. Jerry’ll survive my desertion
for once.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Luncheon at the Arms was at one o’clock. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>lacked only a few minutes of one when Marjorie
came downstairs to find Jonas and deliver her note
into his hands. She had stopped only long enough
to bathe her slightly pinkish eye-lids and draw on
a pretty buff sports coat and hat.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had hardly progressed the length of the long
stone walk leading to the gate when her drooping
spirits began to revive. She was not shallow, in
that she could lightly throw off the impression of
the morning’s reading. She was strong-willed
enough not to allow it to gain a distressing hold
upon her. Most of all she wished to forget her
dejected suppositions which concerned Hal.</p>

<p class='c005'>Outside the gates of the Arms she paused to
decide on which way to go. Should she walk to the
town of Hamilton, or toward the campus. A walk
into staid, drowsy Hamilton meant nothing more
than a lonely prowling up and down the main
streets. To go toward the campus! There was
no telling who she might meet. Marjorie chose
the campus, and variety.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now by King John’s castle where may you be
going?” Leila Harper called out the salutation
as she swept past Marjorie in her car. A moment
and it had stopped. Leila leaned far out of it,
beckoning. “Have the feet to hurry,” she ordered.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>“I have just been to town, but I’ll take you back
again in a trice, if you say.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t want to go to town.” Marjorie shook
an emphatic head. “Take me for a spin, Leila Greatheart.
I’ve quit biographing for the day and I wish
to be amused; wish to be, and hope to be.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am that amusing! And you must have heard
it. Now who told it to you?” Leila cocked her
head to one side and smilingly awaited an answer.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Leila Harper,” laughed Marjorie. “I hope she
knew what she was talking about.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I hope so,” Leila echoed fervently. “Let us
take a ride, Beauty, to Orchard Inn. I should be
busy with my Irish play this afternoon. I have no
thoughts for it. We are both less gifted than we
might be.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Orchard Inn to luncheon sounds comforting.”
Marjorie was settling herself beside Leila in the
car. “It’s a glorious day for a drive. I’ve not
seen you for more than a few minutes at a time
since the Rustic Romp. I’ve only seen Robin once.
She came over to the Arms the day after the Romp
to tell me we made nearly a thousand dollars from
it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did you not hear, Beauty? Someone dropped
a hundred dollar note into the cash box. Miss Dow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>had charge of the box. She had no idea who the
generous rustic might be.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh-h!” Marjorie’s exclamation died in a soft
breath. She had made a quick flashing guess as
to the donor. Leslie Cairns, of course. What an
odd proceeding on her part! Nevertheless Marjorie
gave her the benefit of having been animated by
a generous motive. She had undoubtedly come prepared
to give such a sum. Marjorie was also of the
opinion that Doris Monroe had paved the way for
Leslie’s lark.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is not a campus performance to give such
wealth,” smiled Leila. “I mean outside the Travelers
and a few such princes as Gentleman Gus and
her train of hearties. I thought Ronny might be
the one. She accuses Vera; and so it goes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whoever gave it must have wished her identity
to be a secret.” Marjorie would have liked to tell
Leila of Leslie’s lark. She had made up her mind
that night, however, to be silent. Three persons besides
herself knew it. No, only one, Doris Monroe.
Jane Everest and Julia Peyton lacked the evidence
of their own eyes. Unless Julia Peyton should gossip,
Leslie’s uninvited presence in the gymnasium
would not be known.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Since we have the gold, why should we seek
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>the miner,” Leila said genially. “‘The Knight of
the Northern Sun’ is coming on grandly. Next
Tuesday evening we shall give a full rehearsal. I
trust our spear proof silver buckram helmets will
fit our Norse warriors. Kathie is a true playwright,
but I am a Celtic fake. It is hard to glorify my
hero, since I am to be the hero myself. I am in
a fine dilemma,” she complained drolly. “Why did
I ever imagine I could write an Irish play?”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was an hour’s run by automobile to Orchard
Inn. It was the most distant from the campus of
the coterie of tea rooms dear to the hearts of the
Hamilton girls. The route lay for the most part
over Hamilton Pike. The last three miles of the
journey had to be made over a dirt road. It was fairly
smooth and easily traveled except when roughened
by heavy rains.</p>

<p class='c005'>The two girls kept up a low steady stream of
conversation as the car sped on toward the Inn.
Both were feeling the pleasantness of a brief freedom
from everything connected with even their beloved
work. Neither had expected to take a trip
to the Inn when she had started out. As a consequence,
both were jubilant over the little excursion.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I almost forgot to tell you something very
important, Leila. We were so busy talking about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>the Travelers’ stunts it almost slipped my mind.
Captain’s coming to the Arms for Easter.” Marjorie’s
voice rang with joy. “That means I can
stay here. Jerry is going to stay, too.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“May I ask whose marvelous managing that is?”
Leila’s eyes grew starry. She adored Mrs. Dean.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Captain’s. You see General will be away on a
trip. Captain knows how much I have to do here,
so she is going to help me by coming to the Arms.
Miss Susanna is delighted. It’s a case of Captain
Bean making Lieutenant Bean and all the Beanstalks
happy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We should start a Beanstalk colony here at Hamilton
and remain here all our days. Would it not
be a credit to the township and a satisfaction to my
old age?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’d love to live in Hamilton Estates, Leila,”
Marjorie confessed. “I care for Sanford because
of Jerry, Muriel, Lucy and a few other chums of
my high school days. If Jerry, Lucy, Muriel and
a few more could be transplanted to Hamilton, I’d
move Castle Dean here, too. Sanford has always
meant a great deal to me. Hamilton means more.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I understand. Midget and I have sometimes
romanced of building ourselves a hut in the land
of college.” Leila looked dreamily away for an instant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>at the peaceful spring landscape. There was
a touch of home hunger in her reply. She was
silent for a little, her attention riveted on picking as
smooth a route as was possible on the dirt road
for the car. The machine had struck a rough, narrow
stretch of ground not more than wide enough
for two cars to pass each other.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hey, ho,” she said, coming back to practicality;
“I am not anxious to meet any cars on this cattle
path.” The words had scarcely left her lips when
a low frame, black roadster, built for speed, appeared
in sight upon the brow of an incline ahead
of them. “Do you see that, Beauty? I had but
to speak when a listening jinxie whisked a black
hob-goblin into my path,” Leila cried out in mild
vexation.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie watched the approaching car with more
than casual interest. A comprehensive glance at
it had informed her as to the identity of the driver.
A young woman was at the wheel, the car’s sole
occupant. Marjorie did not miss seeing the peculiar
expression which showed itself in the other’s face
as she glanced at Leila’s car and prepared to keep
strictly to the proper side of the narrow road.</p>

<p class='c005'>Instead of starting down the low hill the other
motorist stopped her car at the top of the little rise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>of ground and waited for Leila’s roadster to come
up. As Leila’s car came abreast of her automobile
she leaned out and cried: “Will you please stop
your car? I’d like to speak to Miss Dean.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Has the world come to an end?” Leila muttered
in Marjorie’s ear as she complied with the other
girl’s request. “The Hob-goblin is no myth, as you
can see for yourself, Beauty.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <br />I’M SORRY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>With Leila’s muttered comments in her ears Marjorie
had hard work to keep a sober face and maintain
an air of pleasant impersonality toward Leslie
Cairns. She could think of no reason why Leslie
Cairns should speak to her. She thought Leslie
could hardly have guessed her identity since the
Romp. Certainly on that night Leslie had not recognized
her. The fact that she had amiably permitted
Marjorie to conduct her to the door and freedom
was sufficient proof in itself.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good afternoon, Miss Dean.” Leslie’s salutation
was laconic. Marjorie thought she was looking
particularly well in a sports suit and hat of bright
brown English weave. Her irregular, dark features
bore no trace of ill humor. Instead her face was
singularly impassive.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good afternoon, Miss Cairns.” Marjorie’s clear
brown eyes looked straight into Leslie’s small black
ones. She could think of nothing to say. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>therefore waited for Leslie to make the next advance
in conversation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s about the other night, I’d like to speak to
you,” Leslie declared with somber steadiness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pardon me. I am willing to listen to whatever
you may wish to say to me, Miss Cairns, but—I
am with Miss Harper,” Marjorie reminded with
candid courtesy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Harper is welcome to hear what I have
to say to you. She probably knows already that
I—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She knows nothing of—of—certain things from
me. Pardon me for interrupting you.” Marjorie
smiled friendly warning.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am sure she doesn’t,” Leslie agreed with an
odd energy which brought a faint flush of surprise
to Marjorie’s cheeks. “She must have heard it somewhere
on the campus, though. I thought possibly
that screech owl—I’ll say Miss Peyton, one’s
her natural name, the other only a surname, had
published me on the main bulletin board before
this.” Mention of Julia Peyton filled Leslie’s tones
with contemptuous sarcasm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hardly.” The quick sturdiness of the retort
brought a peculiar gleam to Leslie’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It was a mistake—losing my temper as I did.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Leslie’s next speech came with shamed apology.
“I don’t know that it matters specially—now. The
mischief’s done. I had no business in the gym that
night.” She looked at Marjorie as though asking
for an opinion.</p>

<p class='c005'>Leila sat the picture of immobility. Her hands
loosely clasped the wheel. Her blue eyes stared
straight ahead. She affected deep interest in the
immediate road ahead of the car. She had had
no inkling of what Leslie meant until the latter had
made pertinent allusion to the gymnasium. Light
had then broken upon her acute Irish intelligence.
Comprehension threatened to break up her immobile
expression.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is of course true from—from a certain
standpoint,” Marjorie admitted. “If you wish my
personal opinion,” she smiled; “I can’t see but that
your presence there was an added attraction to the
crowd. I have fought for democracy at Hamilton,
Miss Cairns. I can only feel my attitude to be
democratic now. I believe that you went to the
Romp merely to have fun. There could be no harm
in such a motive.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There wasn’t!” Leslie cried in sharply anxious
agreement. “I had grown tired of myself and only
wanted to have a good time. I wouldn’t do such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>stunt, again, though. I’m through with such performances.
I’m through with everything,” she added
with a dull kind of desperation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think I understand how you felt about going to
the Romp,” Marjorie said gently.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Still you wouldn’t have done so. That’s the
difference between your disposition and mine. Never
mind about that. I’ve just one thing to tell you.
I wish you’d believe me. I’m all through trying to
make trouble for you at Hamilton or any place else.”
Leslie’s earnestness was unmistakable.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It—truly, Miss Cairns, it doesn’t make—” Marjorie
colored with growing confusion.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, but it does. I want you to know, Bean—”
It was Leslie who now turned very red. Before she
could offer an abashed apology Marjorie’s merry
laugh rang out.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Please don’t.” She gaily warded off apology.
“You can’t imagine how truly fond I’ve become of
being called ‘Bean.’ It’s funniest of two or three pet
names the girls have given me. Miss Macy has even
composed some funny verses which she calls ‘Jingles
to Bean.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What?” A slow smile succeeded Leslie’s
momentary air of uncertainty as to whether she had
heard aright.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“You have a keen sense of humor, Miss Cairns,”
Marjorie generously continued. “Your costume the
other night showed your appreciation of funny
things. You spoke of Miss Peyton. She was unfair
with you at the dance. I was glad you walked
away from her, and sorry that you should have been
aggravated by her to the point of answering.” Marjorie
tried to lead the subject away from intimate
personalities. She disliked to make apologies. She
disliked far more to receive them. She desired no
promise of future rectitude from Leslie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Leila,” she addressed Leila’s clear-cut Irish
profile, “have you heard that Miss Cairns was
masked at the Romp?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have not.” Leila slowly turned her face toward
Leslie. “May I inquire what your costume
was? I was not in the gym until a very few minutes
before the unmasking,” she explained.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was just a farmer, blue overalls, gingham shirt
and all that sort of thing,” Leslie described briefly.
“I happened to get hold of a particularly silly-looking
mask. That was the funny part of the costume.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And now I will tell you the funny part of your
adventure.” Leila regarded the girl she had ranked
as her pet aversion with a not unkindly glance. “I
have heard nothing about you in connection with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>this funny-face farmer, but I have heard plenty of
myself. It seems I had the credit for being that
one. I was not on the floor while you were. I
waited in my room so as to tease the girls. I had
bet with a crowd of freshies that none of them could
pick me out in that rustic mob.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, that,—” Marjorie began.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is why there was a crowd at my heels all the
time,” finished Leslie rather excitedly. She and
Marjorie both laughed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Even Leila’s austerity of feature relaxed into
an amused smile. “I must have come into the gym
when you were preparing to leave it for I caught
not even a glimpse of such a costume as you had.
Now a rumor is drifting merrily about the campus
that I was the funny mask, but that I changed to
an Irish peasant costume to puzzle the freshies.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How utterly providential!” Marjorie’s opinion
was cordially hearty. “I am afraid I shall be too
busy from now on to enlighten the campus dwellers
concerning their fond delusion.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have plenty to do myself,” was Leila’s vague
inference.</p>

<p class='c005'>Leslie’s eyes traveled from one to the other of
the pair of amused faces. Were these the two
Hamilton girls she had hated so unreasonably when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>a student in college with them? She now dejectedly
wondered why she had hated them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There’s something I must say to you,” she persisted
to Marjorie. “I used to hate you. That is,
I thought I hated you. After I found out who you
were I knew I could never hate you any more. You
took with you all my weapons of offense. Why
should I ever have hated you? The answer goes
back to myself. You ought to hate me. But I
know you don’t. That makes me double hate myself.”
Leslie made an impatient movement of the
head, indicating her distaste for herself.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I never hated you, Miss Cairns. I’ve felt dreadfully
exasperated with you at times,” Marjorie
honestly admitted. “I haven’t felt that way toward
you for a long time,” she added with her winsome
smile.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s good news.” Leslie faintly answered the
smile. Her hands began to tighten on the wheel.
“Oh, yes, I almost forgot. Miss Monroe had
nothing to do with my campus lark. I planned it
myself. She knew of it, but it wouldn’t be fair to
censure her for what I would have done anyway.
Will you stand by her if—if any gossip should
start about the affair?” Leslie looked almost appealingly
from one to the other of the two
Travelers.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>“You need have no fears in that respect,” Marjorie
promised staunchly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There will be little or nothing said,” was Leila’s
dryly authoritative prediction.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you both. That’s all, I believe, except—I’m
sorry. I’m saying it, though about five years
too late,” Leslie declared bitterly.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie made no verbal reply. She bent upon
Leslie a glance brimming with toleration. Its frank
kindness made Leslie feel like bursting into tears.
Pride alone kept her from it.</p>

<p class='c005'>After a moment Marjorie said: “We have something
to thank you for, Miss Cairns; the hundred
dollar note you dropped into the money box the
evening of the Romp. We understand and appreciate
the spirit that prompted the gift. When I
say we, I mean the Travelers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie made the assumption boldly, hoping
thus to take Leslie unawares. She succeeded. Leslie
colored hotly. Hastily she started the motor.
“Good-bye.” She smiled a queer, wry smile;
nodded first to Leila, then to Marjorie. Next instant
her car had passed theirs and was speeding
away from them.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> <br />BEGINNING TO GROW UP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Can that be Leslie Cairns?” marveled Leila.
“You will now kindly tell me a great many facts
about her recent history which I have somehow
missed. You intended to tell me about them, did
you not?” She regarded Marjorie with laughing
suspicion.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I had not intended to tell you or anyone else
that she attended the Romp,” Marjorie said emphatically.
“I never even mentioned it to Jerry.
You see what a good secret keeper I am. Since
you have heard a part of the story from the heroine
herself, I may as well tell you the rest.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Leslie Cairns’s wits are as ready as Jerry’s
when it come to giving out names,” was Leila’s
comment after Marjorie had informed her of the
set of circumstance at the Romp in which Leslie had
so prominently figured. “Jerry and Muriel named
Miss Peyton the Prime Minister. That was appropriate
enough last fall when she tried so earnestly
to dictate a policy of her own to we poor timid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>P. G.’s. It seems she has practiced screeching as
well as dictating. And she looks like an owl!”
Leila’s intonation was full of false enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I made up my mind not to tell Miss Cairns
about Miss Peyton and Jane Everest. It wasn’t
necessary. She is worried now for fear Miss Monroe
may be blamed. It seems odd, Leila, that Leslie
Cairns should have shown consideration for another.
I say it candidly; not spitefully. She ought
to be protected if only for that change toward
growth.” Marjorie was very earnest in her conviction
regarding Leslie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is a nine days’ wonder to me.” Leila was
impressed in spite of her earlier impulse to be
skeptical. “If nothing is brought up against Leslie
Cairns now on the campus, nothing will be later.
The time of interest for a rumor is just before,
at the time, or just after something supposedly happens.
The Romp is now almost a memory. Soon
along will come something new and amusing to
crowd that memory out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is still the other side of it, Leila.” Marjorie
grew grave. “It was against good taste in
Leslie Cairns to step into the social side of Hamilton
College under cover of a mask. She had forfeited
the right to do so when she left Hamilton two
years ago.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>“Still it is the most harmless piece of mischief
that she ever carried out. And she dragged no one
else into it,” Leila said thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Precisely the point, Leila. I’ve felt so about it
ever since I went to the door of the gym with her
that night.” Marjorie spoke her mind forcefully.
“I couldn’t regard her lark as anything but a lark.
Her costume was so funny and she behaved in such
a funny, original way. She was more like a child
than a young woman. It was as if she had slipped
through the gate of a high fence, and into a forbidden
yard. She acted as if she were having a
fine time playing. Perhaps she went over a rustic
road to childhood that night, and when she came
back found herself changed?” Marjorie made
fanciful suggestion.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It may be so. All the fairy tales are not hatched
in the Emerald Isle.” Leila cast a sly smile toward
her fanciful chum. “More’s the pity that I instead
of she should be given credit for her costume. For
that I shall see to it that she gains in another direction.
Ah-h-h!” Leila gave the wheel an inspired
jerk which sent the car bumping into a rut. “I have
just thought of a plan to keep the Screech Owl
from screeching on the campus.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have you? I’m glad to hear it.” There was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>a hint of grim enthusiasm in the reply. “What
will you do?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall have to try it out on her first and tell
you my method afterward. It is only the ghost of
a plan yet.” Leila made evasive answer.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie did not inquire further into Leila’s
“ghost” of a plan. “All right. Keep it to yourself.
I only hope it will be effective. It’s hard to believe,
isn’t it, that we should be planning now to
protect Leslie Cairns? When one stops to remember
that she—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never did anything but harass and torment
us,” supplied Leila, “it is that amazin’.” Her accent
became strongly Hibernian.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s not quite what I meant to say, but it’s
true. We can afford to be generous to her, Leila.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, yes. It is more becoming to old age,”
sighed Leila, then chuckled. “As ancient, tottering
P. G.’s we are so merciful!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s one explanation. It will do as well as
another,” laughed Marjorie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We have an old Irish saw that runs: ‘What is
the gain in beating a knave after the hangman has
him?’” Leila lightly quoted the quaint Celtic inquiry.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is the use? That is exactly the question,”
Marjorie smiled in sympathy with the pertinent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>old query. “Leslie Cairns has made things far
harder for herself than for us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The two girls fell silent after Marjorie’s remark.
Both were thinking of the past five years in which
Leslie Cairns had figured so unpleasantly. Neither
cared to continue the conversation with Leslie as the
chief topic. The lure of Spring had chained them
both to dreamy admiration of her budding beauty.</p>

<p class='c005'>The automobile had swung into the last lap of
the road to Orchard Inn which wound in and out
like a pale brown ribbon among orchard belts of
fragrant pink and white bloom. Orchard Inn itself
to which they would presently come, was a staunch
brick relic of colony days, set down in the midst
of thick-trunked, gnarled apple trees. Just then
they were burgeoning in rose and snow, scented
with Spring’s own perfume.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie had always been a devoted worshipper
at the shrine of Spring. The glorious resurrection
each year of earth, which had lain stark and drear
under winter’s death-like cloak, seemed to her the
mystery of mysteries. Today the very sight of
brown fields turning to emerald, apple, pear and
cherry trees rioting in ravishing bloom, the twitter
of nesting birds, busy putting the last touches to
their tiny homes, filled her with retrospection. Sight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>of a peach tree, a luxuriant bouquet of vivid pink
gave her a sensation of unutterable sadness.</p>

<p class='c005'>She understood dimly that her mood of wistful
sadness was born of more than her ardent love of
Spring. She was still gripped by the supreme
tragedy of Brooke Hamilton’s love story. She almost
wished she had not read it. She was sure
that she could never bear to read it over again. In
the next breath she made sturdy resolve that she
would. She would not allow herself to be affected
to such an extent even by a story as sad as was
Brooke Hamilton’s.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, without invitation, Hal invaded her
thoughts. She was no nearer being in love with
him than she had ever been, she reflected with an
almost naughty satisfaction. Nevertheless, the moment
she began to think about love, he appeared,
a blue-eyed image of her mind, always regarding
her in the same sorrowful way, in which she had
caught him viewing the portrait of the “Violet
Girl.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie had no suspicion that she had changed
a great deal in mind since the evening at Severn
Beach when she and Hal had walked together with
their friends along the moonlit sands and Constance
had sung “Across the Years.” She had listened to
the sadly beautiful song, which had breathed of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>blighted hopes and love’s misunderstandings without
either sentimentality or sentiment of mind. Hal
had characterized her faithfully when he had told
her that she had not yet grown up.</p>

<p class='c005'>Neither he nor she knew that the growing-up
miracle had begun when she had laid her childishly
curly head on the study table and cried out her heart
over Brooke Hamilton’s tragic love affair.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <br />THE MEETING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>While Marjorie and Leila rode on through
fragrant spring bloom to Orchard Inn, Leslie
Cairns drove slowly toward the town of Hamilton.
She was filled with many emotions, but the chief
one was that of surprise at the way in which she
had been received by “Bean” and Leila Harper.
She had always stood a trifle in awe of Leila and
her cleverness when the two had been classmates
though she had affected to despise the gifted Irish
girl. Marjorie she had hated from the first meeting.
Or thus she had narrowly believed until she had
come into the knowledge that “little friend ruffles”
and Marjorie were one and the same. She had also
come into a knowledge of Marjorie which she could
not ever again overlook.</p>

<p class='c005'>A friendly act on Marjorie’s part, the prompting
of a broad tolerant spirit had been the magic which
had worked a well-nigh unbelievable change in Leslie.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>It is often the small, seemingly unimportant
happenings in life which frequently are instrumental
in working the most amazing transformations.</p>

<p class='c005'>While Marjorie was going through one process
of growing up Leslie was going through another
widely different phase of the same process. Leslie
had begun to learn that: “He who breaks, pays.”
Until her garage failure she had been childishly
stubborn in her belief that she could successfully
“get away with” whatever she undertook to accomplish.
She had suffered untold mortification of
spirit over the ignominious end her father had put
to her business venture. She had read and re-read
the letter which her father had at that time written
her until she knew every scathing word of it by
heart. This in itself had produced a beneficial effect
upon Leslie’s wayward character. In time to
come she would regard that particular letter as the
turning point in her life.</p>

<p class='c005'>The downfall of her business hopes had furnished
her with gloomy retrospection for long days after
she had returned to New York. With all the fancied
grudges she had against Marjorie she was obliged
to admit to herself that “Bean” had certainly not
been responsible for her father’s unexpected visit
to Hamilton. Neither was she to know until years
afterward that a “Bean-inspired” advocate of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>justice in the person of Signor Guiseppe Baretti had
proven her business Waterloo.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sullenly obeying her father’s stern command to
renew her intimacy with Natalie Weyman, Leslie
had reluctantly got into touch again with Natalie.
Natalie, however, was betrothed to a young English
baronet. She was consequently interested in nothing
but herself, her fiancé and an elaborate trousseau of
which she was imperiously directing the preparation.</p>

<p class='c005'>Leslie felt utterly “out of it” at Nat’s playhouse.
She lounged in and out of the Weyman’s imposing
Long Island palace with the enthusiasm of a wooden
Indian. She listened in morose silence to Natalie’s
fulsome eulogies upon her fiancé, Lord Kenneth
Hawtrey, the Hawtrey ancestral tree, her own
trousseau and the two-million dollar settlement her
father proposed to make over to her as a bridal
gift. Leslie mentally tabulated each of these fond
topics upon her bored brain and learned to know
by the signs just when each of them would be complacently
brought forward by her former college
chum.</p>

<p class='c005'>When she could stand the strain no longer she
had announced to Mrs. Gaylord that her father had
gone to Europe and that she intended to buy a new
roadster and drive to Hamilton. “You can stay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>here or go along, Gaylord. Suit yourself. My
advice to you is to stick to me. Peter the Great
will approve of such devotion on your part. He
knows I’d go, even if you were to try to squash the
expedition. Your part is ‘Never desert Leslie,’”
was the succinct counsel she gave her chaperon.</p>

<p class='c005'>While Leslie was engaged in driving slowly toward
Hamilton wrapped in her own half sad, half relieved
mixture of thoughts, a tall man in a leather
motor coat and cap ran down the steps of the Hamilton
House and sprang into a rakish-looking racing
car parked in front of the hotel. His heavy dark
brows were corrugated in a frown. His lips though
firmly set harbored a grim smile.</p>

<p class='c005'>He had driven through the sunny streets of sedate
Hamilton that afternoon as one who knew the place
but had been long away from it. This was his
second call at the hotel. On both occasions he had
seen and talked with Mrs. Gaylord. His business,
beyond a few, dry unreproving sentences, was with
Leslie Cairns. As Leslie confidently believed him
to be in Europe she was scheduled to receive a
decided shock.</p>

<p class='c005'>Peter Cairns, for the man in the racer was he, was
soon speeding over Hamilton Pike, through Hamilton
estates and on past the college wall toward a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>squat stone building which had the appearance of
an old-time inn. In front of it he parked the racer
again and strode up the long stone walk toward the
quaint low door with its swinging wrought iron
lamp.</p>

<p class='c005'>Within the restaurant Signor Guiseppe Baretti
was in earnest consultation with his manager. He
glanced up at the newcomer, who, instead of choosing
a table and making for it, headed directly for
him. That the little, shrewd-eyed proprietor of the
restaurant and the broad-shouldered financier had
a bond in common was plainly evident from the
way in which they shook hands at the close of the
financier’s short call.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What you think? What you think?” the Italian
excitedly demanded, catching his manager’s arm as
the door closed behind his caller. “This is the
father the girl we write the letter about. When he
comes here, just now, a little while, he says to me:
‘How’r you? You don’t know me. I am Peter
Car-rins.’ I think this mebbe where I get the hard
beat, cause I have tol’ this man what trouble his
daughter make Miss Page, Miss Dean. But this
is what say: ‘I am to thank you for your letter.
I have not the time today talk much with you.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Before long I come here again. Then I tell you
som’thin’ su’prise you verra much.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“I say then to him I think he come to give me
the good beat for my letter. He laugh. He say:
‘No, no.’ Put up his hand like that.” Baretti illustrated.
“‘I un’erstand you verra well. I have been
much in Italy. I know the Italiano.’ Then he speak
me good Italiano. Now that is the father Miss
Car-rins. What you think? She is here in Hamilton
again. Mebbe her father don’ know it. I
believ’ he don’. Mebbe she don’ know he is here.
When both find out, then oo-oo, much fuss I guess.
Mebbe Miss Car-rins get a good beat,” he predicted
with a hard-hearted chuckle.</p>

<p class='c005'>If he had walked to the door after Peter Cairns
instead of lingering to acquaint his faithful little
countryman with the identity of the stranger, he
would have seen something interesting. He would
have seen a trim-lined black roadster slow down to
a sudden stop as the result of a peremptory hail from
a racing car which had drawn up alongside. In
short, Baretti would have seen Leslie Cairns and
Peter Cairns meet precisely in front of the east-end
gates of the campus.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXII.<br /> <br />A BUSINESS PROPOSAL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Run your car off to one side where it won’t
interfere with the traffic.” The financier ordered
Leslie about precisely as he might have ordered one
of his men. His tones reached her, coldly concise,
entirely devoid of affection. “There, that will do.”
He skillfully manipulated the racer to a point parallel
with her car, but out of the way of passing
automobiles.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you want?” Leslie inquired with sulky
coolness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What are you doing here?” sternly countered
her father.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nothing. You took away my job.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A good thing I did. I ordered you to stay in
New York. Why are you not there? Why didn’t
you obey me? You’re courting business college,
it would seem.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Things are not always what they seem,” Leslie
came back laconically.</p>

<p class='c005'>The financier set his lips anew. It was either that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>or smile. Leslie was regarding him with the curiously
unafraid expression which had most amused
him in her as a child.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why can’t you behave properly?” he demanded
with vexed displeasure.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know. I have been trying to find that
out for myself lately. It’s a hard job, Peter.” She
purposely called him Peter. It had been another of
her laughable childish mannerisms.</p>

<p class='c005'>It brought a smile, reluctant and fleeting to his
face. An odd light burned in his eyes for an instant.
He turned his head to avoid her penetrating
gaze. He had never before heard Leslie make an
allusion to self-analysis. The knowledge that she
had begun to try to fathom her forward motives was
encouraging.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What mischief have you done since you came up
here?” he next asked. “Why could not you have
cultivated Natalie instead of racing over the country
up here in a car?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nat is going to be married to a monocle and an
English title. She is hopeless. I couldn’t stand
her. I fled to the country, Peter. I knew you
wouldn’t wish to have me die of being bored. Don’t
rag Gaylord for it. I made her come here. She’s
a good, ladylike sport, who knows how to stick to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>me and yet mind her own affairs. You may think
you picked her for me. No, no; I saw her first.
That gives me a prior claim to bossing her. I’m
glad I met you, if only to settle that little point in
your mind.” Leslie’s hands busied themselves with
the wheel. “I think I’ll go on,” she declared tranquilly.
“Don’t worry, Peter, I won’t do anything
more to disgrace you. I’m going to lead a noble
life from now on.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She was fighting desperately to maintain humorous
indifference. It was the side of her character which
Peter Cairns most appreciated. She was now fighting
to regain the proud interest he had once taken
in her ready wit and irresistible humor. Her reprehensible
behavior had amounted to stupidity.
Peter Cairns most hated stupidity in man or woman.</p>

<p class='c005'>Peter Cairns repressed an audible chuckle at this
latest news from his lawless daughter. “This is
not the place to discuss ethics,” he said dryly. “Run
your car into town and meet me in the hotel lounge.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Race you in; cross town, or any old way?” Leslie
proposed on impulse. She eyed her father doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c005'>For a long moment the two stared into each
other’s faces, as though each were endeavoring to
determine the strength or weakness of the other.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“I’ll go you.” Peter Cairns spoke with a finality
which set Leslie’s heart to pounding violently.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My car was built for speed and I know how to
get the speed out of it without arousing the natives.
Look out, and don’t get pinched.” Leslie brought
her car up on an exact line with the racer. “One,
two, three, go to it,” she called animatedly. Then
she was off over the pike on not only a go-as-you
please race to Hamilton. She was on the first lap
of what she hoped would be the quick road back to
her father’s heart.</p>

<p class='c005'>Leslie won the race. Peter Cairns was not familiar
with the short cut she took. It bumped her car
over a stretch of uneven paved street but brought
her triumphantly to the entrance of the Hamilton
House at least a minute ahead of her father’s car.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why did you pick Hamilton of all places to
come back to?” Peter Cairns was presently demanding
of her. The two had seated themselves opposite
each other in a deserted corner of the lounge.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Probably the scene of my many crimes held a
fascination for me,” Leslie advanced with a reflective
air that completely upset the financier’s hitherto carefully
preserved gravity. He laughed outright.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What did this Miss Dean against whom I understand
you had so much spite ever do to you that was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>unfair or dishonorable?” His alert features had
quickly returned to their customary aloof cast.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not a blamed thing, Peter,” she said in a tone
of sober humiliation. “You were right. I am several
kinds of idiot, bound in one volume. The war’s
over. I surrendered this afternoon, just before I
met you. Whatever you know about Bean and me
is probably true.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who is Bean?” demanded Peter Cairns.</p>

<p class='c005'>Leslie enlightened him. At the same time she
quoted Marjorie’s own recent remarks on the subject.
“You can see from that why I quit,” she said.
“There was nothing else to do. Some day, when
I’ve really put over a good square business enterprise
I’ll tell you the story of Bean, her Beanstalks and
Leslie Adoree.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your first business ought to be to repair the
mischief you made,” was the severely judicial response.
“Unfortunately you can’t undo the anxious,
troubled hours which your malice has imposed upon
others. You have taught me a lesson. I needed
it. My code of finance has been that of a hawk. I
have revised it on more humane lines. I’d rather
not have learned it from your mistakes. But it’s
been learned now. I am not sorry I cut you off from
me. Perhaps it was not the way to do. I don’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>know. I loved you very tenderly as a child, Leslie.
I was proud of you as a youngster. I should like
to be proud of you as a young woman. What are
the prospects?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good, Peter. The best since the days when I
was your pal and we planned to conquer the universe
together. I’m trying to think of a way to make
amends.” She met her father’s measuring glance
with an air of patience quite foreign to her old
wayward self. “I like it up here. I’ve a girl friend
on the campus. I really like her. I want you to
meet her. Gaylord approves of her. What more
can you ask?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll take you at your word.” For the first time
since meeting her father he held out his hand.
Leslie placed her right hand in his strong fingers.
Her left reached out very timidly and covered the
hand she held. It was the silent ratification of affection
between Peter and Peter Cairns’ daughter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How did you know I was here?” she asked after
a brief silence.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I told Wilkins, my secretary, to keep track of
you. I made only a flying trip to Europe. He told
me you were here. I drove here soon after leaving
the steamer. I had business at Hamilton Estates.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What are you going to do with my garage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>flivver?” A gleam of intense curiosity lived in Leslie’s
eyes. “You said in your letter that some day
I’d know why I had no business to buy the property
for the site. Is today the day?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It may as well be.” Peter Cairns looked away,
his mind evidently engaged in choosing the words
for his next utterance. “My name isn’t Peter
Cairns,” he said deliberately. “It’s Peter Carden.
Alec Carden was my father. I ran away from him
and his harsh tyranny. I changed my name to
Cairns. The old Scotch name of our family was
Cairrens. It became Carden in James the First’s
time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What?” Force of surprise brought out Leslie’s
habitual monosyllable. She wondered if she
were awake or dreaming. Had her father, a lord
of finance, once been a hot-headed rebellious boy
who had changed his name and run away from
Carden Hedge?</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, what?” her father repeated half ironically.
“My father left Carden Hedge to John, along with
all he had. He disinherited me. When I went I
took with me a bundle of bonds from the safe. They
were mine; left me by my mother. I went to New
York and made good. All this by the way of explaining
about the garage site. You paid John Saxe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>sixty thousand dollars for a site that belonged to
the Carden Estate. Not a foot of it belonged to
the Saxe Estate. I had it surveyed and proved the
Carden right to it. Saxe refunded the money. He
was innocent in the matter.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Leslie’s downcast reception of this last crushing
surprise touched her father. “Buck up, Cairns II.,”
he said in the hearty, affectionate tone which Leslie
had been dreading, yet longing, to hear. “I know
I handed you a hummer. Now there’s not much
more to say, except that I bought Carden Hedge
over two years ago of John. I’ve let him live there
off and on, simply to have someone look after the
property a little. I thought once of living there
myself. I changed my mind. It’s a pretty country
up here. I liked it when I was a boy, and do still.
I must be on my way tomorrow. How long would
you like to stay in Hamilton?” He questioned with
the old deference he had formerly observed to her
wishes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’d rather go back to New York with you.” Leslie
fought to keep her voice steady. “I can’t. I
want to stay on here a little and try to find a way
to do something for the dormitory, or the college
or the students—anything I can do to make up for—”
She paused, regained composure, went on. “I’m
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>to blame for keeping you out of happiness. I cheated
myself, too. How could you care to live at the
Hedge after what I did at Hamilton? I have learned
the big lesson this time. I’d go back to college and
begin all over again in spite of what might be said,
if I could, Peter. I’d do it for you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Peter Cairns saw a white-winged evanescent
grace called happiness flit before his eyes. It had
whisked away the day he had learned of Leslie’s expulsion
from college. “Perhaps we’ll yet live at the
Hedge, Leslie,” he said. “We can do that much, if
we can’t go back in other ways. Now I’ll make a
bargain with you. If you can find any good and
original reason for keeping your flivver I’ll give the
whole business to you as it stands. It must be
original, though. That’s the chief requirement.
And it must be something that will benefit Hamilton
College students, faculty, dormitory—in fact the
whole aggregation. Go to it. You perfect the plan.
I’ll finance it for you. Nothing but the best will
be accepted by me in the idea line. I’m going to
try to prove that my girl has as good a brain as
there is going.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /> <br />A GREAT DAY FOR THE CAMPUS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Julia Peyton could have forgiven Doris Monroe
for disagreeing with her. To be told by Doris
that she was an object of dislike to the lovely
sophomore was not to be borne. She held frequent
indignant consultations with her roommate, Clara
Carter, on the double subject of the ingratitude of
Doris and the snippiness of Marjorie Dean. Julia
had not forgiven Marjorie for her “interference”
at the Rustic Romp.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus far she had not voiced the gossip on the
campus that the foolish-faced farmer at the hop had
been Leslie Cairns. She was a little afraid that such
a bit of gossip on her part might bring down upon
her Marjorie’s displeasure. She knew in her heart
that she was the only one of the four girls who
would be likely to spread the story. Later on, when
the Romp had been forgotten she would tell her
friends about that horrid Miss Cairns and how she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>had stealthily slipped into the social side of Hamilton
under cover.</p>

<p class='c005'>Finding the desire to gossip irresistible she and
Clara Carter entertained a soph with the tale one
evening in their room. The soph, Lena Marsden,
a quiet studious girl, had a flourishing crush on
Doris. She promptly acquainted Doris with the
ill news under promise of secrecy. “If some one like
Miss Mason or Miss Harper, or any of the P. G.’s
who have poise and influence would reprimand Miss
Peyton, maybe she’d not talk about it any more.”
was Lena’s opinion.</p>

<p class='c005'>Leslie’s repeated unkind and untruthful estimate
of Marjorie had tended to destroy Doris’s confidence
in her, at least. Julia herself had spoken slightingly
of Hamilton’s most popular post graduate. Doris decided
that of the seven post graduates she knew the
two most likely to command the difficult silence of
Julia were Veronica Lynne and Leila Harper. Her
final choice fell upon Leila. She and Leila had grown
quite friendly as the rehearsals of “The Knight of
the Northern Sun” progressed. As her Norse lover,
Godoran, Augusta Forbes and Doris had also progressed
from stiff civility to real friendliness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will you come to my room this afternoon about
five, Miss Harper?” Doris requested on the day before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>that of a complete rehearsal of the play. In
the act of leaving the dining room after luncheon
Doris paused for an instant behind Leila’s chair.</p>

<p class='c005'>“With pleasure. I may be a little late, but I
won’t fail to come,” Leila assured. Supposing
Doris’s request had something to do with the approaching
rehearsal, Leila thought nothing further
about it. It was twenty minutes past five that afternoon
when she knocked on the door of Doris’s
room. It was the first time she had been asked to
enter it by Doris. Muriel never entertained her
chums there, “for fear of freezing them,” she always
said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There’s something I must ask you, Miss Harper,”
Doris opened the conversation with an anxious little
rush. She went on to lay the case of Julia’s spite
against Leslie before Leila. “I am sorry to have
to mention Miss Cairns’s name even to you. There
seemed only this one way. I know I can trust you.
I know you can suggest something.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Leila listened with laughter in her blue eyes. She
had already been agitating her resourceful brain on
the matter of Julia’s garrulity. The plan she had
dimly formed on the day when she and Marjorie
had driven to Orchard Inn had developed better
even than she had expected.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>“I think I have a way of managing her,” she said
with a flashing smile of confidence.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She is not easy to manage,” warned Doris. “It
will take something unusual to make an impression
on her. She is envious and jealous and that blinds
her to see much good in any one.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will see her when I leave you. I have seen
Miss Cairns, Miss Monroe. Miss Dean and I met
her on the way from Orchard Inn several days ago.
She spoke to Miss Dean in my presence of the Romp.
She is your friend, I believe, and is anxious that
you shall not be blamed for anything. That is really
all I wish to say in the matter.” Leila gave Doris
a straight, significant glance.</p>

<p class='c005'>Doris settled back limply in her chair, “I—I—am
surprised,” she stammered. “I wish you—no, I
don’t, either. I’ll ask Leslie. She will tell me what
it’s all about. I like Leslie, Miss Harper.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I like her myself better than I used to,” was
Leila’s careful answer.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have you—”</p>

<p class='c005'>Doris did not finish. The door was flung open
and a breezy, delighted shout of “Leila Greatheart!”
ascended as Muriel Harding rushed upon Leila and
hugged her. “Welcome to our cubicle! Why didn’t
you tell me you were coming to see me?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>“I cannot tell a lie. I didn’t come here to see you
at all, at all. I came to see Miss Monroe. Now
I must be going. You may both come to see
Midget and me this evening.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I can’t—that is—not this evening,” Doris
protested weakly. She dearly wished to accept the
invitation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She means she won’t come if I do,” Muriel
cheerfully supplied. Muriel’s tone did not accord
with her feelings. She was actually hurt, but gamely
refused to show it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I meant nothing of the sort,” Doris contradicted.
Instantly she reflected that she had meant precisely
that. “I beg your pardon,” she addressed Muriel
stiffly. “I did mean that. I don’t now. I will
come this evening, Miss Harper.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good night! I shall expect you both.” Leila
flashed out of the door, hurriedly closing it after
her. Left to themselves the two girls might effect
an understanding. She knew that Muriel was still
vague as to why Doris had suddenly turned against
her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suppose we have it out this time, just to see how
wrathful we can be,” Muriel proposed, a shade of
satire in the proposal. “That’s the only way I know
to break up a situation that’s been hard on both of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>us. I’ve always thought the wires were crossed
somewhere in Harding’s and Monroe’s last fight,
but I couldn’t prove it. Harding’s and Monroe’s
last fight! Doesn’t that sound thrilling? It makes
one think of Indians, cowboys, rattlesnakes, buffaloes,
prairies and—geese,” she ended with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I hope it will be Harding’s and Monroe’s last
fight,” Doris said with sudden energy. “I know now
that a certain other person was to blame for most
of it. I know that you were not trying to be kind
to me or belittle me. I’m not so sure about Miss
Dean.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She loves you, Doris Monroe.” Muriel sprang
into affectionate defense of Marjorie. “You never
had a more faithful crush. She is the one who
started the name of the fairy-tale princess for you.
She has adored your beauty and wanted you to be
in theatricals so that you could be seen and admired.
She was the judge who delivered the adjuration
to Beauty at the beauty contest. She is
the best friend you have on the—”</p>

<p class='c005'>Muriel stopped at sound of an odd little murmur
from Doris. The fairy-tale princess had dropped
into a chair with her golden head pillowed on
one arm. Muriel’s torrent of loving defense had
fallen upon Doris like verbal hailstones. In fending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>for Marjorie she had forgotten her own side of the
estrangement.</p>

<p class='c005'>While the two were deep in amiable and verbose
adjustment of their disagreement Leila was calling
upon Julia Peyton. As she afterward confided to
Vera: “I was there, Midget, with my tongue in
my cheek.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Her interview with moon-eyed Julia appeared to
be eminently satisfactory. She soon left the garrulous
sophomore’s room, followed by Julia to the
door. Leila managed to walk down the hall to her
own room after the interview with an air of dignity
becoming to a post graduate. She was well
aware that Julia stood in the doorway of her room
watching her. When she was safely within the walls
of her own domicile she astonished Vera by making
a laughing dive for her couch bed. She flung
herself upon it and gave way to merriment.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You should have been with me, Midget,” she
gasped. “I have had a lively time with the Screech
Owl and the Phonograph. I have written a part
for Miss Peyton in my new Irish play of ‘Desmond
O’Dowd.’ It is that of Derina, the village gossip.
She has not read it yet. When she does, I may have
the part but no Screech Owl to play it. If you wish
to tie your enemy’s hands, offer him an honor. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>have written the part of Derina especially to show
this soph what she is. By the time she has rehearsed
the part several dozen times she will wish to be any
body but this one. I shall give her my personal attention.
You know what that means. She may
need a rehearsal every day. Hard on Leila. But
think of the good to humanity!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ingenious, you old star worshipper,” laughed
Vera. “Do you know she is, I believe, almost the
only gossip on the campus. That’s fine for Hamilton,
isn’t it? Every day we are growing better and
better. Speaking of goodness reminds me of our
own Marjorie. She and Jerry are coming over this
evening.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And I am expecting company; Matchless Muriel
and the Ice Queen. Are they not a fine combination?”
Leila cast a sly smile of triumph toward
Vera. “How do you like my news, Midget?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m flabbergasted. Honestly, Leila, have those
two patched up their quarrel?” Vera exhibited delighted
wonder.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Honestly, they have. Know, Midget, that I am
always honest.” She drew down a disapproving
face. “How can you ask me such a question?” Immediately
her engaging smile broke forth. “I have
certainly a cheering budget of news for Beauty tonight.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>What with the thawing of the Ice Queen
and the taming of the Screech Owl this has been
a grander day on the campus than that of the Kerriberry
Fair, in County Kerry, ould Ireland.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <br />THE HAPPIEST PERSON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Easter vacation brought Captain Dean to Hamilton
Arms and tumultuous happiness to Marjorie’s
heart. Greatly as she had come to love the Arms
for its stately marvelous beauty and comfort, the
loving devotion of Miss Susanna and the fact that
it had been the home of Brooke Hamilton, she now
loved it more strongly because it was graced by
her adored captain’s presence.</p>

<p class='c005'>Since the morning when she had read the journal
of Brooke Hamilton she had not written another
word of his biography. “I can’t write,” she plaintively
complained to Miss Susanna. “Spring and
Captain and Brooke Hamilton’s journal have all
got into my brain and won’t be shoved back. I’ll
have to get all over the strenuousness of them before
I can go on writing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think I shall lock up the study for a while,
anyway,” Miss Susanna threatened. “The Army
owes a duty to its superior officer. I shall order
Lieutenant Dean out on guide duty to Captain Dean.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Ensign Hamilton and Corporal Macy will go along
for company.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i>Corporal Macy.</i>” Jerry elevated her nose in
deep disgust. “I’m a lieutenant myself. Kindly remember
it. An ensign doesn’t belong to the Army.
An ensign belongs properly to the Navy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall be the great exception,” persisted Miss
Susanna, laughing. “Ensign sounds well with
‘Hamilton.’ It is not seemly for youth to scornfully
contradict age.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“First show me age,” retorted Jerry. “There
ain’t no such animal around here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m going to take Captain for a walk around the
estate this morning,” Marjorie announced. “There
are oceans of things I want to show her and talk
about. Almost every bush or tree at the Arms has
an interesting history, all its own. Ensign Hamilton
and, ahem, Corporal Macy are cordially invited
to join the walk around.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i>Lieutenant</i> Macy doesn’t regret that she has an
engagement with Major Jonas Kent to plant dahlias
this morning. Major Kent is far more polite than
certain other officers of the detachment of far lesser
rank,” Jerry declined with significance.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ought to be, and I am, the happiest person in
the world, I believe.” Marjorie later voiced this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>fervent opinion as she sat on a rustic bench between
her Captain and Miss Hamilton.</p>

<p class='c005'>The three had seated themselves in the sweet
spring sunlight at indolent ease after a long ramble
about the magnificently kept grounds of the Arms.
Under their feet the young green grass wove a soft
living carpet. Over their heads spread the iron-strong
branches of a mammoth tulip tree.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Just because I am so happy, every once in a
while I think of Mr. Brooke, Miss Susanna. Then
I grow sad for a little. How beautiful it would
have been for Angela and him to live here year after
year in the perfect happiness of love! I often wonder
how he had the courage to go through so many weary
years after she left him. He chose such a patient,
brave-hearted way.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Perhaps he accomplished more of good because
of such a sorrow than he might have wrought without
it,” sighed Miss Hamilton. “From the time of
Angela’s death he centered himself more than ever
on the founding of Hamilton College. It might well
be called a monument to the two women he loved.
The nobility of plan and execution were inspired
by his mother. But the beauty of nature which he
cultivated and carried out with such rare taste and
sentiment on the campus is his tribute to Angela.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Day after day, early and late, he busied himself with
enhancing the beauty of that overgrown grass plot.
Perhaps his spirit communed with hers as he worked.
This was before my time. You will find a packet
of what he named, ‘My garden letters,’ among the
data. If you haven’t already been over it, you have
a joy in store for you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Susanna stared absently out over the sea
of living green splashed with the pale pinks, yellows
and scarlets of early blooming shrubs. Mrs.
Dean had taken no part in the conversation, preferring
to listen. Marjorie’s wistful observation regarding
Brooke Hamilton and Angela Vernon had
raised a feeling of surprise in her mind. It was
the most sentimental word she had ever heard Marjorie
utter.</p>

<p class='c005'>Since her arrival at the Arms she had been permitted
by Miss Hamilton to read the journal over
which she had heard the Lady of the Arms and
her lieutenant have several long discussions. Jerry
had also been permitted to read it. She had at
first cried over it, then impatiently characterized
stately Brooke Hamilton as a “lovable old stupid”
for not “getting it across” first thing that Angela
was in love with him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have a perfectly celostrous idea, children.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Marjorie thus gaily designated the two beside her.
“It came out of what you just said of Mr. Brooke
and the campus.” She lightly clasped Miss
Susanna’s arm. “I’ll put Mr. Brooke’s love idyl in
‘Realization,’ together with his nature work on the
campus. That will do away with having to write of
how he made Angela unhappy for so many years
because he didn’t know he loved her. I will state
only that they met first when very young, and without
knowing their own hearts. I think I will keep
the entry about her riding down to the station with
the picture to say good-bye to him.” Marjorie
turned to Miss Susanna, her eyes questioning.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are to do as you please, Marvelous Manager.”
Miss Susanna smiled into the beautiful,
colorful face so near her own. “If you wished to
publish the journal verbatim, I’d not gainsay you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know you wouldn’t, Goldendede.” Marjorie
returned the smile with interest. “I don’t wish him
to be misunderstood. He was not intentionally selfish.
He was simply wrapped in his own great
dream. The world, were it to read that journal,
might call him hard-hearted. Even he reproached
himself after he found that he loved Angela. I will
leave out anything that I should not care to say of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>him myself. I pledged friendship with him in the
beginning, you remember.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am glad you feel as I do about his love affair.”
Miss Susanna said with a grateful little nod. “I
have always thought mention of it, at least, important
in a biography of him. I was not sure what to
do. I had thought, at the time when I talked with
President Burns of having it prepared for publication,
of submitting only a brief paragraph or two
about Angela Vernon. I leave the matter contentedly
to you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s enough to bring back my lost inspiration,”
was the blithe declaration. “Come on, both
of you.” Marjorie sprang to her feet. She stretched
an inviting hand to both her mother and Miss
Susanna. “I shall proceed to hustle you about the
rest of the grounds before luncheon. I’m going
to the study to work this afternoon. Don’t dare lock
it up.” She laid energetic command upon Miss Hamilton.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s to become of my sight-seeing tour?”
doughtily demanded Miss Susanna.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Corporal Macy will conduct it. Order her to
it, and promise her a commission of major,” Marjorie
merrily proposed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, genius is really beginning to burn again,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Miss Susanna teasingly commented. “Jerry shall
earn her commission.” As she spoke she had allowed
Marjorie to pull her to her feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let’s walk down by the gate,” Marjorie proposed.
“I wish Captain to see that wonderful
Chinese white lilac bush that once grew in the royal
Chinese gardens.”</p>

<p class='c005'>They were not more than halfway across the space
of lawn intervening between the rustic seat and the
white, feathery plumed lilac bush when the eyes of
all three picked up the trim lines of a small black
roadster which had stopped at the entrance gates.
There were two persons in the roadster. One of
them, a tall, broad-shouldered man in gray tweeds
and motor hat to match, was already out of the car.
He had turned to give an assisting hand to a young
woman who vaguely resembled him. She smiled
happily at him as she stepped lightly to the ground.
The two turned their backs on the car and approached
the gates.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s Leslie Cairns!” Marjorie said in a low, astounded
tone.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s—Can it be?” Miss Susanna shaded her eyes
from the sun with a small, sturdy hand. “I believe
it is—Peter Carden!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXV.<br /> <br />UNDER THE TULIP TREE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Well, Peter, the years have dealt lightly with
you,” was Miss Susanna’s greeting as she held out
a hand to Alec Carden’s runaway son.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had heard from Marjorie of the recent
agreeable change in Leslie Cairns. Marjorie had
felt it only fair to Leslie to acquaint Miss Susanna
with that change. The old lady now divined that
Peter Carden had come to the Arms on a friendly
errand. Her quick brain had instantly arrived at
the truth as she glanced from Leslie to Peter Carden.
Leslie was his daughter. Followed immediately
the recollection of the financier’s altered name.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So you changed your name to Cairns, and this
is your daughter,” she continued with abruptness.
In her astonishment she momentarily forgot to
make introductions.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes.” Peter Cairns showed admiration of the
intrepid little woman who had successfully fought
off his bullying father and a college board largely
composed of rascals. His keen eyes registered an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>expression of deference which he seldom accorded
either men or women. “This is my daughter, Leslie,
Miss Susanna.” He drew Leslie gently forward.
“She came to meet you and to see Miss
Dean. I came to see you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m glad you have. I might not have said that
years ago, but I can say it now.” Miss Susanna
introduced Peter Cairns and Leslie to Mrs. Dean,
and the financier to Marjorie. The latter and Leslie
had already exchanged friendly salutations.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie thought she had never before seen Leslie
look so well. Beauty, even prettiness of the
regulation type she would never have. There was
a new expression of light and animation on her
face, however, which made her what her father
had often called her as a child: “his ugly beauty.”
The loose, unprepossessing droop to her mouth
which Marjorie had formerly most disliked in her
features was gone. A half humorous little quirk
had taken the place of the ugly droop. It brightened
her face wonderfully. Always of extremely symmetrical
figure she was at her best today in a pale
blue broadcloth dress. The softening grace of a
wide summer fur draped her shoulders. Every detail
of her apparently simple toilet had been carefully
chosen. Leslie was a model of smart attiring.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t feel much older than when I was Peter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>Harum-scarum, as John used to call me,” smiled
the financier. “I have had many a good and many
a bad time at the Hedge. It has been mine for two
years. I bought it from John. I am glad old Alec
died. A hard thing to say of one’s own father,
perhaps. He had a hard hand, and a hard nature.
I was glad to hear that you fought things to a finish
with him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You may say what you please to me about Alec
Carden, Peter. I know it will be the truth. I dislike
to hear a man who was detested by his children
while he lived hypocritically mourned by them after
Providence has mercifully removed him from their
midst,” Miss Hamilton declared with candid relish.
“Come up to the house and have luncheon with
us. I hear you are a king of finance. Your history
after you ran away from home must be interesting.
You weren’t more than twenty-four when you
went, were you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Twenty-five.” Peter Cairns laughed, a short
bitter sound. “Thank you for the invitation, Miss
Hamilton. Some other day we’ll accept with
pleasure. We have a business engagement today
with a man named Peter Graham.” He and Leslie
looked at each other and laughed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her glance toward him was a vivid brightening
of feature which Marjorie thought beautiful.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>“Won’t you come over and sit down under the big
tulip tree?” she invited winningly. “We have been
sitting there in the sunshine loving the spring outdoors.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, do. Peter, go and bring that seat over
here under the tulip tree with the other,” directed
Miss Susanna pointing out a nearby rustic seat.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes’m.” The usually silent, taciturn man, who
kept his large office force in a state of continual
awe, ran like a boy to bring up the rustic bench
and place it under the tulip tree opposite the other.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, Peter, what in the world prompted you to
come to see me?” the old lady inquired briskly, as
she re-seated herself on the bench. Mrs. Dean
courteously excused herself and walked on to the
house. She decided that the four she had left
would get along better without her. Miss Susanna
and Leslie sat on one seat. Marjorie and Peter
Cairns on the other.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, a number of things,” Peter Cairns replied
with an odd little duck of the head which Miss Susanna
recalled him as a boy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You two,” she indicated father and daughter,
“are full of pleasant mystery. Your faces give you
away.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is pleasant mystery; very pleasant,” he replied
with friendly conviction. “This is what it’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>all about.” In his short-cut fashion he quickly outlined
what he had already informed Leslie regarding
the ownership of the site she had chosen on
which to build the garage.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I took the property away from Leslie because
I was not pleased with her,” he continued frankly.
“Saxe refunded the money. He was entirely innocent
in the matter. I took the sixty thousand dollars
refund and invested it for Leslie. It was her
money. She had paid far too much for the site.
As the site belonged to the Carden estate and the
Carden estate belonged to me I took over the whole
garage enterprise. Leslie had to bear the loss of
the money she had used for construction and other
foolish purposes. I wanted to show her what a
flivver she’d made.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We agreed to tell this tale together. I’ve told
my part of it. Now Leslie will tell hers. Your
turn, Cairns II,” he raised his heavy brows meaningly
at Leslie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My father told me if I could think up a good
reason for having my garage site back again, he
would give it to me. The requirements were that
whatever I wanted it for must benefit Hamilton
College and all connected with it. He said it must
be an original reason.” Leslie came to the point
with the same celerity as was Peter Cairns’s habit.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>“I tried at first to think of something that would
work out with your plans, Miss Dean,” she now
addressed Marjorie. “I knew you had long since
provided against emergency. Every time I thought
of the word originality I thought of Leila Harper.
I used to think when I was at Hamilton that she
<i>was</i> originality.” Leslie smiled briefly. “Miss
Monroe raves over her. She says she is a dramatist,
stage manager, actor and so forth. This is my
idea. I’d like to build a theatre on the garage site.
I’d call it the Leila Harper Playhouse. I’d present
it to Hamilton College with the proviso that Miss
Harper should always control the theatre and the
policy of the plays. I would like to will her to
Hamilton College as a rare dramatist, actor and manager.”
Leslie paused. Once fairly started on her
proposal she had grown more and more animated.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You take my breath!” Marjorie gave a little
rapturous gasp. “I should say your plan was original.
I think it’s the very heart of gracious generosity.
I love Leila, Miss Cairns, and wish more than
I can say to have her appreciated and honored at
Hamilton.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She ought to be appreciated. She is going to
be. You see a theatre will be of benefit to all the
campus folks. It will be a source of amusement
and pleasure to all. The money resulting from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>the plays should go to help the dormitory along.
It will train girls who have histrionic ability for
the stage. It will encourage students to play-writing.
There will be prizes offered, so many each
year for the best in plays, perhaps for exceptionally
fine acting. My father will endow it. I shall put
a part of my money into the endowment provided
my idea is accepted by the Travelers. My name is
not to be mentioned in it. My father doesn’t wish
his to be, either.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“None of the Travelers could or would refuse
such an offer, Miss Cairns. Remember it is first
of all for Leila. She has worked so hard to give
the campus good plays. Not to mention all the
splendid things she’s done for Hamilton as a
Traveler.” Marjorie sang Leila’s praises with a
high heart. “Yet none of us would wish yours or
your father’s name to be withheld. It would be
our grateful pleasure to tell others of your splendid
gift.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You make it seem the thing for us to do—I
don’t know. Let me come again and talk with you
about it. My father and I are partners now,” she
threw him a fond comradely glance. He and Miss
Susanna had listened and let youth talk out its
own matters of interest.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was an hour later when Peter Cairns and Leslie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>left the Arms, happy in the long step that had been
taken that day toward the partnership of which they
had talked and dreamed in bygone years in New
York.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Susanna has changed more than any other
person I ever knew,” were the financier’s first words
to Leslie as they drove away from Hamilton Arms.
“She was a sweet woman until after she had so
much trouble with my father and that rascally
board. I was only a little boy then. I never saw
her again after I left Carden Hedge until a few
years ago when I came up here to see John. She
looked like a fierce, sullen little creature of the wild,
ready to snarl at a word. Now she is charming.
She looks as though she had found what we have—happiness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Blame it on Bean,” Leslie said with a shadow of
her old satiric smile. “She can change anything.
She even put over the great transformation on me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Back at the Arms Jerry, who had successfully put
dozens of plump dahlia tubers into the soft brown
earth under Jonas’s somewhat critical eye, was now
racing across the lawn to the tulip tree.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I saw the company from afar. Who were
they?” she called out when within a few feet of
the rustic benches where Miss Susanna and Marjorie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>had reseated themselves. “No one I ever saw
before. I couldn’t label either one of them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have seen them both before, Jeremiah,”
Marjorie calmly assured. “The young lady was
Leslie Cairns. The man was—our gasoline bogie.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What-t? Has one hob-goblin wed another.
Don’t tell me the grand Hob-goblin is married!”
Jerry looked ridiculous consternation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who said anything about being married. The
gasoline bogie is Leslie Cairns’s father.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then he must be a house robber. What was
he doing around the Carden estate at that hour of
the night?” Jerry demanded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He is not a house robber.” Marjorie was now
laughing. “He is a house owner. He owns Carden
Hedge, and his name is Peter Carden. He is the
Carden son who ran away from home and changed
his name to Peter Cairns.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good night.” Her eyes on Marjorie, Jerry went
to sit down on the end of one of the two benches.
She missed the bench and sat down forcefully on
the soft grass.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Can you beat it?” she giggled as she scrambled
to her feet and dropped down beside Marjorie, this
time in the middle of the bench. “Can you blame
me for that flivver? I’ve heard of being overcome
by astonishment. It just happened to Jeremiah.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXVI.<br /> <br />THE IRISH MINUET</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The Travelers presented “The Knight of the
Northern Sun” at the Hamilton Concert Hall on
the evening after that of the re-opening day of college
following the Easter vacation. Lucy Warner
had asked and received President Matthews’s hearty
permission to use the hall for the Norse play and
afterwards for any other attractions which Page and
Dean might wish to offer.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Norse play was the most ambitious drama the
Travelers had yet undertaken. They had gone to
great trouble and pains to costume and produce the
play inexpensively, but with realism. Nor was the
audience which crowded the large hall to the doors
composed entirely of students. Since the presentation
of the first show by Page and Dean almost
two years previous, interested citizens of the town
of Hamilton and residents of Hamilton Estates had
shown flattering eagerness to obtain seats for Page
and Dean’s shows.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Augusta Forbes scored heavily as Godoran, the
Norse hero, who, until he met the fair Nageda,
boasted that he had looked earnestly at no woman’s
face save his mother’s. Doris was the lovely,
golden-haired Nageda, who fell in love with Godoran
at sight but was carried off as a hostage by barbarian
hordes on the day of her initial meeting with
her hero.</p>

<p class='c005'>The play netted the dormitory fund over a
thousand dollars. Augusta and Doris stepped into
the spot light of campus admiration and were fêted
by their friends for upwards of a week afterward.
Marjorie attended the presentation of the drama with
her mother, Jerry, Miss Susanna and Jonas. It was
her mother’s last evening at the Arms and this sad
knowledge put her in a rather forlorn mood. Then,
too, she could not help thinking of Hal. She had
suggested the title of the play as a result of seeing
the costume of polar knight Hal Macy had worn at
the merry-making in Sanford on Christmas Eve.
Now she saw Hal as the knight, rather than Gussie.</p>

<p class='c005'>She wondered vexedly why she always thought
of Hal in connection with the sentimental. It was
because he had told her he loved her, she supposed.
She watched fascinatedly the progress of the play
and listened with half impatient sadness to the impassioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>words of love which Katherine Langly,
who knew nothing about love, had put into the
mouth of Godoran.</p>

<p class='c005'>Following the play and her mother’s departure
for Sanford, Marjorie returned with conscientious
interest to the work of the biography. Since the
love story of Brooke Hamilton had entered into it
she had revolutionized her whole idea of the plan.
Now she plunged once more into the journal, working
at it diligently. She tried to use every sentence
of it which did not touch too personally on the side
of the great man’s romance which belonged to him
and not to the world.</p>

<p class='c005'>After a time it seemed to her that she knew every
line of the journal by heart. She worked steadily
on through the bright spring weather until she had
arranged the delicate matter to suit her critical
mind. Miss Susanna was greatly pleased over Marjorie’s
arranging of the sentimental part of her
great-uncle’s history. She had taken a notion to
edit the garden letters herself, and the two friends
worked together in the study at the long library
table, each with the same fond spirit toward the
man in the portrait.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the campus Leila Harper in fancy had ceased
to be a post graduate. Instead she was living through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>an exciting period of Irish history as she rehearsed
the heroic part of Desmond O’Dowd. As the time
drew near for the presentation of the Irish drama
she grew more pleased with the work of the cast
than she had ever been with that of any other group
of actors whom she had formerly used in her plays.
Vera, as Mona of Lough Gur, the Irish maid from
County Limerick, promised to be the chief attraction.</p>

<p class='c005'>One thing to perfect her production Leila lacked.
She needed a real man, one with an exceptionally
sweet tenor voice to sing words to the minuet tune
that accompanied the Irish minuet she and Vera were
to give in the first act of the play. As the hero it
was really Leila’s place to sing the quaint words as
she danced. Not being possessed of a tenor voice
she could not carry out this part of the program.
She decided after much thought to place a singer in
the wings to voice the pretty Irish words.</p>

<p class='c005'>Next difficulty was to obtain the singer. Following
a brief season of despairing calculation as to
whether a church singer in Hamilton might not undertake
the solo, Leila hit upon another plan that
brought a true Cheshire cat grin to her keen Celtic
features. She hastily mailed a very ragged piece
of Irish music to Hal Macy with a short accompanying
letter, and buoyantly awaited results.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>Leila’s plan to bring Hal from Sanford to sing
behind the scenes for her on the night of her play
was not entirely one of self-interest. She had often
thought Marjorie was nothing less than a sleeping
beauty slated to awaken suddenly from a dream of
life to reality and a lover’s kiss. She had long
guessed for herself that Hal loved Marjorie. She
had also been the only one besides Marjorie who
had seen Hal’s heart-broken expression as he had
stood before Marjorie’s portrait.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of late Leila had shrewdly thought she had
noticed signs of absent-minded dreaming on Marjorie’s
part which might or might not have to do
with Hal. Miss Susanna had decreed that Marjorie
might tell the original Travelers of the journal
if she wished. Leila had listened to Marjorie’s sad
account of it and her wistful remarks afterward with
her head on one side. She had there and then made
up her mind to try out an experiment of her own
upon Hal and Marjorie.</p>

<p class='c005'>In due time Hal’s answer returned. Yes, he would
be pleased to help her with her play in any way
he could. He would make it a point to keep out
of sight until after the performance. This Leila
had also requested. He had learned the Irish song
and thought it very pretty. Leila was tempted more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>than once to tell Jerry. She triumphantly fought
off the desire and cannily kept her own counsel.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now wholly engaged in what promised to completely
outdo “The Knight of the Northern Sun,”
Leila paid little attention to anything else. As she
worked steadily and patiently toward perfecting the
various actors in the difficult Celtic characters they
were to represent she did not dream that she had
already been selected as an object for honor.</p>

<p class='c005'>Leslie Cairns had determined that Leila should
receive her gift, and her father’s, of a theatre on the
last day of chapel. Leslie had always remembered
and been impressed by the various honor citations
which she had witnessed when a student at Hamilton.
She believed that Leila would prefer to be honored
in the company of her fellow students in chapel than
at the regular Commencement exercises. She argued
that the gift she wished to offer Leila was germane
to the traditional side of the college.</p>

<p class='c005'>While Leila was carrying on a lively correspondence
with Hal, Marjorie was wondering now and
then why she had not heard from him. With Hal
so much in her mind of late it was not strange that
she should notice his delay in writing. She had
written him over a month ago. He had not written
to Jerry, either. Perhaps he had been away,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>or had been ill. No; if he had been ill Jerry’s mother
would have mentioned it to Jerry in a letter. Marjorie
realized, all of a sudden, that she had grown
quite concerned in the matter. She chided herself
for being silly, and dismissed Hal from her
thoughts—until he happened to walk into them
again.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Say, have you heard from old Hal lately?”
Jerry asked her on the evening of Leila’s play, as
the two girls were dressing for the event. “Because
I’m going to wear my turquoise necklace I happened
to think of him. He gave it to me, you know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve wondered myself why he hasn’t answered
my last letter.” Marjorie stood before the long
wall mirror surveying herself with a critical and unenthusiastic
eye. She was dressed in the shaded
violet frock of Chinese crepe which she had owned
for five years and which was still a la mode. She
had worn it only on rare occasions. It was still fresh
and charming as on the night when she had worn it
as a freshman to the Beauty contest. Leila had begged
her to wear it “in honor of your Celtic friend
and Irish playwright,” she had laughingly stipulated.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’s probably away on a business trip for the
governor.” Jerry delivered this opinion as she poked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>her arms into her white fur evening coat. “Don’t
forget your violets.” She patted the huge bunch
of scented purple beauties at her own corsage.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie turned from the mirror. She took her
own bunch of violets from the water, dried the
stems and pinned them on. The faint exquisite perfume
of them all but brought tears to her eyes.
She thought of Angela, of Brooke Hamilton, of how
they had loved violets. And then—back went her
mind to the winter day when Hal had stood before
the portrait of a girl who wore violets.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m going for a long, long walk tomorrow,”
she announced. “My head is full of cobwebs. I
shall let the fresh air sweep it clear. I hope there
will be a good old high wind blowing. I’ll love to
walk out and fight with it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll go with you. Bean. Never believe you can
lose me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I look upon you as a permanent fixture,” Marjorie
graciously assured.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Make the most of me tonight. I’m going to
leave you tomorrow. I happen to remember that I
can’t be always with you.” Jerry trailed out the
remark in a melancholy tone. “I like the permanent
fixture idea, but I can’t be it. I have to go the round
of the campus houses tomorrow and see what I can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>gather up for the auction. There are times when
I wish I were not quite so necessary to Hamilton,”
was Jerry’s regretfully modest ending.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You don’t know what you are talking about.”
Marjorie gave a funny little chuckle. “First you
said I couldn’t lose you. Then you said just the
opposite.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know it. I seem to be like that, don’t I?”
Jerry beamed foolishly upon her lovely chum.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie got into her own evening coat, a springtime
affair of pale tinted silk and lace, and the pair
paraded downstairs arm in arm. Jerry’s nonsense
had served to restore Marjorie’s lighter spirits to
normal light-heartedness. During the short ride in
the limousine to Hamilton Concert Hall an energetic
conversation occupied the attention of all three.
It concerned the library which was to be presented
to the dormitory girls when the dormitory should
be completed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Susanna was determined that the students
who were now the dormitory seniors should be
present the next fall when the dormitory would be
finished and opened. She had just announced her
intention of defraying the railway expenses of the
graduate “dorms” wherever they might be.</p>

<p class='c005'>All three were also happy over Guiseppe Baretti’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>present to the dormitory. He had long announced
his intention of giving the “dorm a nice present.”
A few days previous he had sent for Robin and
Marjorie and solemnly informed them that he
wished to take the expense of furnishing the dorm
with the best grill room that money could secure.
“I buy all for it; all,” he declared with an inclusive
spread of the arms. “Then I do this. What you
want buy. You give me the list ev’ry week. I
buy for the dorm same I buy for me. This don’
cost me half’s much it cost the dorm.” His offer
was accepted with the same deep gratitude which it
seemed to Marjorie that the Travelers owed almost
everyone.</p>

<p class='c005'>The orchestra pit of the hall looked like a florist’s
shop. As the trio entered the fragrance of roses
and violets was wafted to their nostrils.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Um-m. All the actors are in line for a donation,”
muttered Jerry. “I hope our offerings to the bunch
haven’t been side tracked.” The Travelers had gathered
up among themselves a goodly sum of money
for the purpose of honoring the members of the
cast with flowers. Vera’s dainty pen and ink were
all gone before the Hamilton Arms detail reached
there.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Mason said to tell you that she had saved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>some sketches for you,” was the comforting assurance
that met the party at the door. The message
was delivered by a sophomore who was doing usher
duty.</p>

<p class='c005'>Seats of honor well up front had been reserved
for the mistress of the Arms and her bodyguard.
Seated in the brilliantly lighted room, the perfume of
flowers on the air, the pleasant, well-bred murmur
of subdued voices in her ears Marjorie thrilled to
it all as she had always vibrated to the social side
of Hamilton College.</p>

<p class='c005'>She loved to think of herself as a part of it,
alive and moving along with that busy, mind-profitable
life. She was glad that she had such clever,
wonderful friends. Not one of her chums but that
had specialized in some particular talent or craft.
She alone was the only one who had no hold on the
fine arts beyond being an appreciative worshipper
of those who were talented. Thus her thoughts
ran until the rise of the curtain on “Desmond
O’Dowd.”</p>

<p class='c005'>From then on she thought only of the play itself.
Leila herself had arranged the most of the
setting for the first act. The opening scene was laid
in the old-fashioned hall of an Irish country house
of early eighteenth century. Desmond O’Dowd, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>hero, whose free thinking and free speech had placed
him in disfavor with the Earl of Claflin, had come
to Claflin Eyrie, the earl’s home, in the hope of seeing
Mona, the earl’s niece. He wished to say goodbye
to her before joining a revolutionary political
party which he believed to be the only one working
for the good of Ireland.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was during this act that Leila and Vera were
to dance the Irish minuet of which the Hamilton girls
were so fond. The play opened with a number of
young men and women of Mona’s acquaintance
gathered for a little evening party. The high-waisted,
comparatively simple costumes of the young
women were dainty foils for the dark knee trousers,
square cut coats, silk stockings, fancy low shoes and
lace falls of the young men. Shoulder length hair,
ribbon-tied, formed a part of the picturesque dressing
of the young Irish gentlemen of this period.</p>

<p class='c005'>After a gay little dance in which the whole
company joined, came the entrance into the hall of
Desmond. Leila played the part with true Celtic
intensity and understanding. Vera who took color
from constant association with Leila, was no less
convincing in the role of dainty Mona. Marjorie
leaned forward in her seat breathlessly waiting for
the moment to come which would introduce the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>minuet. She had seen it danced by the two a number
of times and never tired of it. She was particularly
fond of the charming setting of words that went
with a part of the tune. The minuet had special
music which Leila had brought from Ireland and
which was very old.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Leila can’t sing the words this time,” Marjorie
whispered to Jerry. “She was grumbling to me
about it not so very long ago. She can’t sing like
a man and she doesn’t care to sing them in her own
voice.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The pleading, persuasive voice of Desmond to
Mona, saying: “Just one dance, acushla. Tomorrow
I’ll be far away across the lakes and with only
the thought of you and your love to keep my poor
heart from breaking.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie breathed a long sigh of anticipatory
pleasure as the preliminary strains of the minuet
rose from the orchestra pit where Phillys Moore
was conducting her own capable ten piece orchestra.
With the usual number of deep, courtly bows the
minuet began. Followed the gradual advance down
the center of the pair of dancers. The odd, dainty
stepping, dignified in its deliberateness. Each step
in perfect accord with each note of the music combined
to make a poetry of motion difficult to describe.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>Then—From somewhere off stage a voice suddenly
began to sing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Down the center little one,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Life for us has just begun:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Down the center, step together,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Only you and I are one forever.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Colin he is watching me,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>His love you can never be,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Step together, part we never</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Sweetheart wee.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It was a high, sweet tenor voice, vigorous of
tone yet giving the Irish lilt the true lyric delicacy
necessary to the rendering of any Irish song. Marjorie
listened to it, entranced, yet with the vague
impression that she had heard it somewhere before.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Forward, forward,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Higher, sweeter, sounds the measure,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>You for me, my small white treasure</div>
      <div class='line in1'>You for me, for now and aye, love.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The voice sang on, seeming to grow more and
more impassioned. The tender import of the love
words brought a quick veil of tears to Marjorie’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>eyes. It was all so real. The two lovers, surrounded
in the very beginning with unsurmountable difficulties,
their brave attempt to defy life and fate.
Ardent Desmond pleading for the constancy of his
“small white treasure.” Then that voice, ringing,
a thread of defiant laughter running through its
music.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie came back to reality in time to hear an
excited voice in her ear growling softly: “Old Hal.
Now can you beat that. It is Hal that’s doing the
singing. I know it. That’s some of Leila Harper’s
work. Oh-h-h. Wait until I grab both of them.
I’m going behind the scenes the minute the show’s
over. I’d go at the end of the first act, but I might
make a nuisance of myself. If Hal Macy knows
what is good for him he will march himself out
front like a kind and loving brother.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie heard Jerry’s words in a kind of pleased
daze. She was conscious of one emotion above
everything else. She would be very glad to see
Hal. She wished he would soon come to them.
But Hal did not appear. Wily Leila had enlisted
his services in helping with a mob scene at the end
of the second act. She needed him again to direct
another third-act ensemble where the revolutionists
gather about their chief, Desmond O’Dowd, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>haunted house at the foot of the Cragsmore cliff.
Leila knew precisely what she was about in keeping
Hal from Marjorie. She was certain both Jerry
and Marjorie must have recognized his singing voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the final curtain had descended after Leila
and the cast had been surfeited with flowers and
curtain calls, and after Leila had made a speech
of few and embarrassed words, Hal had still not appeared.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let him go.” Jerry had grown out of patience.
“I disown him. I never had a brother. I’ll will
old Hal to Leila Harper for a stage hand. She has
kept him back on the stage and made him work.
She—” Jerry suddenly subsided with an articulate
murmur.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie looked blank. She had never before
thought of Leila Harper in conjunction with Hal.
How had Hal happened to know the words to the
old Irish song? Leila must have sent them to him
by letter. No, she must have sent the music for
the minuet. She thought that he had not been in
Hamilton more than a few hours. Still he might
have been on the campus all day and she had never—</p>

<p class='c005'>There she stopped. Leila was her most devoted
friend. She was glad that Hal had at last shown
a preference for some one beside herself. Marjorie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>stopped the thought process again. She found she
did not wish to think about Hal and Leila as being
interested in each other. She wondered next if they
had been corresponding long. Leila had never mentioned
in her presence that she had received a letter
from Hal. Leila had—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Marjorie.” The sound of the voice whose tender
cadences had lately thrilled her was now speaking
her name, and in the same ardent tone.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Hal.” Involuntarily both hands went out
to meet the strong warm ones which clasped her
slender fingers close.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You gave us a positive electric shock,” complained
Jerry. “How long have you been here?
Give an account of yourself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not very long.” Hal relinquished Marjorie’s
hands slowly, deliberately. She stood looking at him
with an expression of sweet welcome which came
to him vaguely as something he had not hitherto
seen in her face.</p>

<p class='c005'>He had already warmly greeted Miss Susanna.
She was now engaged in conversation with Professor
Wenderblatt, who had come up to speak to
her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There’s Lillian Wenderblatt over by the orchestra
pit talking to Phil. I must see her about the auction.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>Back in a minute.” Jerry had not noticed any difference
in Marjorie’s demeanor toward Hal. She
left the two together on general principles.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Were you surprised to hear my voice before
you saw me?” Hal asked with a smile. He was
trying to tell himself that he must not show Marjorie
that he loved her. She did not like that.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes; I didn’t recognize it for a minute. I only
knew it was familiar—and beautiful,” she added
with her charming lighting up of feature.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you. How are you, Marjorie, and the
biography? You are the portrait girl tonight,
aren’t you?” Hal was struggling valiantly to be impersonal.
He wished instead to say to this lovely
violet girl: “I love you. I love you.” The grace
of her beauty was in his heart. The perfume from
the violets at her waist was a breath of sweetness
to his hungry soul.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, I am wearing my violet dress. I am well.
The biography is progressing very slowly.” Marjorie
felt an odd little chill at Hal’s pleasant inquiries.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m going to the Arms with you,” Hal announced.
“Miss Susanna insists that I shall stay
there tonight. I must be on my way tomorrow.
I’m planning a trip to Alaska. Expect to be gone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>all summer. I’ll go over to the campus tomorrow
before I leave and call on Leila. She certainly is
a grand old comrade.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I love Leila Greatheart, Hal,” Marjorie said
loyally. “I’m so glad you came here to help her
with her play.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Aren’t you just a little bit glad to see me for
myself, Marjorie?” Hal could not resist putting
this one question.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You know I am.” Marjorie attempted to look
into his face with her old-time frank smile. She
smiled, but the smile was one of shyness. Her brown
eyes rested on Hal only an instant. The rose deepened
in her cheeks. Hal looked at her, and wondered.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Why, Hal, I didn’t know you knew that poem!”
Marjorie stood beside Hal at the top of the veranda
steps bathed in the white moonlight. Looking at
her, Hal had quoted the verse of old Irish poetry.
“Leila must have taught you that.” She smiled,
but there was a tiny ache in her heart.</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i>You</i> taught me that. You recited it one night
when we were down on the beach. That was last
summer. It seems longer ago.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So I did. I had forgotten.” For some unknown
reason Marjorie felt lighter of heart. The tiny pain
was gone.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That was a white moonlight night. So is this.
Come and take a walk.” Hal stretched out a hand
to Marjorie.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>“Just a little way.” She followed him down the
steps, but laughingly refused his hand. “I know
this place better than you. I don’t need a guide,”
she said. “We mustn’t go far from the veranda. I
am hungry. We are soon going to have a midnight
supper, especially for you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m grateful for hospitality. What a corking old
piece of magnificence the Arms is! I wish I had
time to see it thoroughly. I’d invade your study
and bother you. I give you fair warning.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why can’t you stay at the Arms for a few days,
Hal? Jerry will be so disappointed. You can’t
know as I know how much she loves you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know.” Hal nodded. “Jerry will be home
before long. But you won’t be home for—” He
paused. “Are you coming home in June?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know.” The answer came doubtfully.
“The biography won’t be finished until some time
next winter. I must come back to Hamilton next
fall to see to our dormitory interest. There are other
things, too. Captain and General wish me at home,
and Miss Susanna wishes me here, and—</p>

<p class='c005'>“I want you myself, Marjorie.” Hal’s quick utterance
had the virile quality now which had thrilled
her when he sang. “Why do I tell you this again
when I’ve sworn to myself I’d never trouble you?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>I don’t know. I only know that you seem to me tonight
to be—kinder.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hal, I—” They were crossing the lawn now
strolling aimlessly along under the moon’s pale rays.
They came to an immense flowering almond bush.
It lifted burgeoning pink clusters, a mass of rioting
bloom under the white light.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hal, I always mean to be kind to you.” Marjorie
did better this time. “I wish you wouldn’t
feel that you have troubled me. I have read Brooke
Hamilton’s love story. I understand more of love
than I used. I know that true love is—it is—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you know of love?” Hal’s hands suddenly
dropped lightly upon her shoulders. The two
had stopped before the great pink bush, facing each
other, their young features set with the terrific
earnestness of youth. “Have you grown up? Do
you love me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I—have grown up this much—I—understand the
worth of true love, Hal. That is—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not loving me yet, but very near it,” came the
tender interruption. Hal’s hands slipped from Marjorie’s
shoulders. “I love you,” he said. “I love
you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marjorie regarded him silently. She knew that
Hal was fighting against loving her. That in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>moment of emotion he had spoken again the words
he had tried to forget. He would instantly go back
to his role of devoted friend. She did not wish
him to go back. She loved him. How greatly she
loved him she could not then guess. She knew only
that she loved him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it, Marjorie?” Hal reached for her
hands, caught them, held them unresisting in his
own.</p>

<p class='c005'>Came a silence. A faint vagrant night breeze
stirred the trees, touched the faces of the two besides
the almond bush. Very gently Hal drew his
Violet Girl into his arms.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It must be a whole year from now, Hal,” Marjorie
said later with charming practicality. They
were walking toward the house now in answer to at
least five minutes’ intermittent whistling of Jerry
from the veranda.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Stop a minute.” Hal drew Marjorie into the
shadow of a tall shrub.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have oceans to do. I told you all about it
a little while ago. Work is work. It can’t be done
in a minute. But it can be accomplished by next
June. Then I’ll be—I’ll be—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Marjorie Dean Macy,” Hal said, and he
punctuated these three euphonic words in true
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>lover’s fashion. The story of that eventful year of
accomplishment and triumph, which ended in the
dawn of a perfect wedding day for Marjorie, will
be told in: “MARJORIE DEAN MACY.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
